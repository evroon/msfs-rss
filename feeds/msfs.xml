    <summary>Yesterday, we hosted another Developer Livestream on Twitch. Among the many topics discussed by our panel were the following highlights:
Sim Update 15 has a target release date of March 26. As always, we want to ship a quality product, so there is a chance this date could be slightly delayed if SU_15 isn’t ready for release by that date.</summary>

    <summary>In case you missed it, we recently announced that the full release of Sim Update 15 (SU_15) will be slightly delayed from its earlier targeted release date of March 26. It’s important that we take the time to get it right, and after careful consideration, the team concluded that SU_15 isn’t quite ready yet. We’re now targeting a release for some time in April (exact date TBD).</summary>
