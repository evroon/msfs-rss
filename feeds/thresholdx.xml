    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries has recently launched its latest scenery for X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12: Iloilo International Airport (RPVI). As the fifth busiest airport in the Philippines, Iloilo International Airport welcomes over 2.3 million passengers each year. Commercial traffic at the airport began in 2007, serving as a replacement for the former Mandurriao Airport. Although it did not operate as a commercial airport before 2007, the site of the current airport has been involved in various aviation activities since 1942. During World War II, an airfield was constructed in 1942. After the war, this airfield gradually transitioned into a civilian airport, accommodating both military and general aviation traffic. Over the years, the airport underwent several changes and construction projects before commencing commercial operations in 2007. â Today, the airport serves airlines such as Cebu Pacific and PAL Express, offering flights to destinations including Cebu, Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, and many others. Airwil Sceneries' depiction of the airport boasts numerous features, including hundreds of custom-made objects, a modeled interior of the passenger terminal, a modeled interior of the control tower, and more. The scenery requires 1.99 GB of storage space and is now available at SimMarket for approximately $11.46. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>X-Plane 12.1.3 Released</title>
    <updated>2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1213"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/677405a51140e8830db3ab17_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Plane 12.1.3 has just been fully released, one and a half months after the first beta release. ATC, the user interface, and sounds are among the most improved aspects of this update. â ATC and sounds According to Laminar Research, the ATC system has undergone a significant overhaul. Radio communications have become much more realistic, including features such as radio checks, clearance requests, and VFR and IFR procedures that support SIDs and STARs. Additionally, the default navigation data has been updated to AIRAC 2306. Users can now copy and paste routes from tools like Navigraph and Simbrief directly into their flight plans. They can also request alternative SIDs and STARs, ask for altitude exceptions, and receive per-turn instructions. Furthermore, X-Plane can now be configured to output ATC audio to a separate audio device. Weather A full weather update is planned, but some changes have been made in version 12.1.3. Issues with sudden altitude and pressure changes during mid flight have been resolved. Additionally, improvements have been made to cloud visualization and interpreting METAR information and wind data. Errors related to the NEXRAD display for document number G1000 have also been addressed. User interface The flight configuration menu now provides more detailed information about gates and ramps. Additionally, the map highlights active runways and shows taxi routes. Several smaller improvements have also been made, including fixing rendering stutters that occurred when displaying UI elements and ensuring that VR windows maintain their positions. X-Plane identity In preparation for the X-Plane Store, the X-Plane identity feature has been released in early access. This feature allows you to link your purchase key to your X-Plane identity. Once you complete the migration, your X-Plane key will no longer be necessary; a simple login will grant you access to the simulator. In the future, purchases from the X-Plane Store will be linked to your X-Plane identity. According to Laminar Research, migrating to X-Plane identity is entirely optional. Several other changes have been implemented, including a handcrafted overhaul of The Downtown Manhattan Heliport (KJRB) and enhancements to the default A330, Cirrus SR22, and Cessna Citation X. â The full list of changes can be found on X-Plane.com. â Version 12.1.4, âThe Flightlessons Updateâ is next up. â For more on that, and more, stay tuned to Threshold.

    <title>Brazil Land Games Releases FlorianÃ³polis International Airport V3 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2025-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/blgflo"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6775e6cdcfe1f86fcb489621_floripa1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Brazil Land Games has recently released its rendition of FlorianÃ³polis âHercÃ­lio Luz International Airport (SBFL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (MSFS 2024 compatible). The airport serves FlorianÃ³polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 3.9 million passengers. It was initially built in the late 1920s as Campeche Field, and the French aviators of the Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale AÃ©ropostale used it for their operations to and from FlorianÃ³polis. In the 1940s, a proper runway and basic infrastructure (apron, control tower, and passenger terminal) were built. As the airport was shared with the Brazilian Air Force, some military infrastructure improvements were also made. The passenger terminal was rebuilt and modernized in the early 1950s and remained in use until the 1970s when a brand-new terminal was opened. The terminal was then expanded in the late 1980s and in 2000, reaching a total area of 8,700 square meters.Â  In early 2017, Flughafen Zurich AG won a concession to operate and expand the airport, which kicked off shortly after in 2018. This included the construction of a new terminal with fourteen new gates, costing 570 million BRL. At the time, the main runway was also extended by 100 meters. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Flybondi, Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Chile, Paranair, Sky Airline, Sky Airline Peru, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, custom landside buildings, a custom terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on their website for roughly $8. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Taimodels has recently released its rendition of Orlando Sanford International Airport (KSFB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, as well as X-Plane 12. Located in Sanford, Florida, this airport serves as the secondary commercial airport for the Orlando area, alongside Orlando International Airport. Last year, nearly 3 million passengers traveled through the airport. The airport was established as Naval Air Station Sanford in 1942 and was utilized by the United States Navy until 1969. That year, the city of Sanford took control of the airport and renamed it Sanford Airport. For the next 25 years, the airport was primarily used for general aviation. In the mid-1990s, a new passenger terminal designed for jet airliners was constructed, marking the beginning of commercial flights to the airport. Since then, the airport has undergone various improvements. Today, Allegiant Air operates the majority of flights from the airport, offering destinations across the country. Both the MSFS 20/24 and X-Plane 12 versions of Orlando Sanford International Airport feature an accurate depiction of the airport, realistic buildings, and a variety of other features to make it as realistic as possible. The MSFS 20/24 version of the airport is priced at roughly $17.95 on SimMarket, while the X-Plane 12 version is available on SimMarket for approximately $19.49.  â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Borgillios Scenery recently released their rendition of NorrkÃ¶ping Airport (ESSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves NorrkÃ¶ping and has a yearly average of 103,298 passengers.Â  Founded in 1934, NorrkÃ¶ping is Sweden's oldest commercial travel airport. Although mostly commercial throughout its history, the Swedish Air Forces briefly used it during World War 2.Â  The airport's traffic peaked in the 1980s, followed by a significant decline shortly afterward due to the rise of high-speed rail connections and the development of larger commercial airports.Â  Despite the challenges, efforts have been made to revitalize the airport and attract new airlines and routes. The airport's location in a strategically important region and its history and infrastructure offer potential for future growth and development. Nowadays, the airport only gets seasonal charter traffic from Braathens International Airways, Pegasus Airlines, and TUI fly Nordic. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, high-detail buildings (terminal, hangars, etc), and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $10.30, requiring at least 166.64 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries has just released its rendition of Sayak Airport (RPNS) for both X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12. Located on Siargao Island in the Philippines, the airport is also referred to as Siargao Airport. Originally built in 1963 under former President Diosdado Macapagal, the airport was designed to accommodate small 19-seater planes. However, significant changes occurred in 2008 when the airport underwent renovations as part of a program aimed at boosting economic activity. Following these improvements, the airport could handle larger aircraft capable of carrying over 70 passengers. Further modernization and expansion took place in 2013. Today, airlines such as Cebgo, PAL Express, and Sunlight Air operate flights to destinations including Cebu, Clark, Davao, and Manila. The newly released rendition of Sayak Airport is rich in features, offering a realistic representation of the airport, including a detailed passenger terminal, a modelled control tower, and more. The scenery requires 1.27 GB of storage space and is now available at SimMarket for approximately $6.15. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. XWind Studios has recently launched its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024: Trenton-Mercer Airport (KTTN). Located in Trenton, the capital city of New Jersey, this airport is a hub for Frontier Airlines, serving approximately 600.000 passengers annually. Trenton-Mercer Airport's history dates back to 1907 when the first airplane landed on Alfred Reeder's field in Ewing. Skillman Airport opened to the public in 1929. During World War II, the local General Motors plant transitioned to manufacturing torpedo bombers, leading to airport expansions to accommodate test flights for these aircraft. The airport was later renamed Mercer County Airport and eventually became Trenton-Mercer Airport in 1995, linking it to the city of Trenton. In 1998, the airport replaced human weather observers with an automated weather system. Although the county plans to replace the old terminal, residents have opposed this idea. Today, Frontier Airlines is the only airline operating at the airport, offering flights to destinations such as Atlanta, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, and West Palm Beach. The newly released scenery features a host of features, including high-quality, optimized textures, detailed terminal interior designs, custom taxiway signage, comprehensive imagery of the entire airport, and much more. The scenery requires 3.95 GB of storage space and is available on iniBuilds for $10.38. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. JustSim has released its first scenery fully adapted for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, revisiting a previous destination: Rhodes International Airport (LGRP). Rhodes is a popular summer destination in the Greek Islands, attracting over 6 million annual passengers. Civil aviation on the island began after World War II with the opening of Rhodes Maritsa Airport, which served as the main airport until Rhodes International Airport, also known as Diagoras International Airport, was inaugurated in 1977. Over the years, the airport has seen improvements, including expanded taxiways and a new passenger terminal that opened in 2005. In 2015, the airport was privatized and is now managed by Fraport AG/Copelouzos Group for a period of 40 years. Today, Rhodes International Airport hosts numerous airlines offering scheduled, seasonal, and charter flights to various destinations across Europe. The new scenery features high-resolution ground textures, high-resolution building textures, highly detailed 3D models, custom animated ground vehicles, and much more. The scenery requires 1.66 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $17.28. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
