    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Today has been an exciting day in the world of flight simulation! Weâre one day into the amazing event that is FSWeekend in Lelystad, The Netherlands, and weâve prepared a roundup of all the dayâs news if you didnât catch it yesterday.  â Todayâs event was kicked off by Magnus Axholt, CEO of Navigraph, and his announcements on some new features coming to their Charts software, chiefly among them being able to now annotate charts, as well as Operational Flight Plans from SimBrief. Along with being able to highlight taxi routes, users are also able to create boxes around important items such as minimum speed restrictions. Along with changes to Navigraph Charts, Axholt mentioned a new project dubbed âNavigraph Academyâ set to debut this fall. According to him, the project âbasically stems from the fact that you guys have been missing an instruction manual."  Moving on to the next announcements, which came from Thompson on the X-Plane team, discussing all that is to come with the upcoming X-Plane 12.1.0. First, he went over how graphics will be improved in the update, with fixes to CPU performance, clouds, and highly requested fixes for the Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) in the sim. Along with those, there are new particle effects, improving immersion in-sim. Thompson went on to describe improvements for the weather system, including a brand new real weather server, as well as improvements to METAR parsing, and fixes for odd weather data. Phillip from the team discussed improvements to avionics, including the G1000, STEC S-360 Autopilot, and new ice/de-ice visual effects. Also discussed during the presentation was additions for Pro users of X-Plane.  After X-Plane came a video showcase from the team at FlyByWire, which featured their highly anticipated A380X, and showed progress on visuals, systems, sounds, and even a fully modeled cabin. You can watch the showcase video on YouTube here and see the amazing work theyâve done! Next up was Mobiflight, hosted by creator Sebastian (who I had the pleasure meeting at FSExpo â23). The main emphasis during their presentation was the power that the flight simulation community has, and how amazing it can be through the power of open source software. Mobiflight also announced that they are getting a new UI and frontend framework, which will include lots of design improvements as well as a dark mode. Last, but certainly not least was a lesser known company amongst the mainstream flight sim community, ProSim. ProSim is mainly known for their aircraft software that can be used to integrate into home built full flight simulators, and is very popular in that market, but has recently gained traction due to the fact that the Fenix A320 was based off of ProSimâs A320. They are also known for their commercial solutions through their fixed base trainers. In their presentation, ProSim renewed their focus on home cockpit building, by launching a new brand, called HomeSim. They have split their consumer business and commercial business, where the consumer side is now HomeSim, and the commercial side is still ProSim. They have a substantial development roadmap for home users, and have rededicated themselves to home simulation. And with that closes a very packed day at Europeâs largest flight simulation convention! But, thereâs still another day, so stay tuned to Threshold for the roundup for Day 2, and a sneak peak behind the scenes on what goes on at FSWeekend!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlyByWire has recently shared a video of their upcoming Airbus A380 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, demonstrating a full flight - albeit with cuts and acceleration - from Toulouse to Munich. â The 10-minute video is their most revealing A380 footage yet, and it shows a bit of the cockpit modeling, aircraft system power-up from cold and dark, engine startup, take-off sounds, and more: â The developers emphasize it's still in development, and the video does not represent the final stage of the product. Designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large aircraft market, the A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner, seating up to 853 passengers in a single-class configuration or 525 passengers in a typical three-class configuration. There's no information on the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Teases Upcoming Boeing 777-300ER for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently broken the silence about which variant is releasing first, along with a full-blown 45-minute live stream answering many questions regarding upcoming features, potential limitations, and more. â There was a lot of mystery surrounding the first 777 variant to release, with a considerable part of the community supposing it would be the 777-200ER for the longest time. It had not been revealed when PMDG shared the first images a few months ago, but Robert Randazzo finally broke the silence during the live stream, revealing it would be the 777-300ER to release first. With the variant out of the way, many people also wanted to know about the presence of RF legs and CPDLC, to which Randazzo responded with a âmaybeâ for the former, and the latter will initially see a basic implementation with Hoppie, which will then get updated in the future with an in-house solution, as Hoppie is said to ânot be a realistic representation of how it works in real life,â according to Robert.  While they still donât have an exact date for the release, Robert expects it to come out within two months if things go according to plan, and it just might have a basic weather radar - albeit sim limited - included, unlike their 737 Lineup.  PMDG has also uploaded a 2-minute showcase video of the upcoming product, with shots of the interior, exterior, and passenger cabin, emphasizing their modern modeling techniques.  Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. It was another exciting day packed with amazing things at FSWeekend in Lelystad, Netherlands! Todayâs presentations were announcements, panels, and weâve prepared a roundup of all the news on the final day of FSWeekend 2024.The first presentation was from Papa Hotel, who showcased his rendition of Lelystad Airport, which is the location of FSWeekend, in Microsoft Flight Simulator! In the presentation, he confirmed features such as custom 3D objects, custom orthophotos, interior modeling for the terminal, and more! He also said that he is committed to upgrading the airport with new features in the future. After the panel by FSElite, which included names such as Andreas from cruiselevel.de, Jamie, more commonly known as LondonController, Jordan from FSElite, and Thresholdâs own Magnus Lorvik, there was a presentation by Mike from FlightSimCoach. Mike discussed aspects of FlightSimCoach, which is a service that helps flight simmers get a more in-depth introduction into flight simming, as well as offers one-on-one instruction with an instructor that can help with anything and is bespoke to a simmerâs needs. Keeping on ahead there was a presentation by ToLiss, being a retrospective on the past decade of ToLiss products. He went into more depth on the ToLiss history, and highlights of the products theyâve released. Also in their presentation was a hint at what aircraft they were working on next, but unfortunately, the only thing that was mentioned was that it was going to be another Airbus aircraft. And with that concludes FSWeekend 2024, and all the exciting announcements and showcases that happened today! Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold, because we have some exciting behind-the-scenes content at FSWeekend weâre excited to share, and weâre so excited on what amazing things will happen at next yearâs FSWeekend!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Skyward Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of their first add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator: the DA-50RG, a five-seat, single-engine airplane. Designed and built by Diamond Aircraft Industries, it was first shown in 2006, albeit unofficially, and test flown for the first time a year later in Austria, followed by its first public appearance in Germany during the AERO Friedrichshafen show. The crisis of 2008 led to the project being put on hold for many years, which explains why it was only certified recently. Powered by a Continental CD-300 Turbocharged engine producing 300 horsepower, the DA-50 RG has a range of 1,389km, with a cruise speed of 319 km/h, and a service ceiling of 20,000ft. The upcoming add-on will feature an accurate 3D model, true-to-life high-definition textures, custom-coded systems, an accurate flight model, Working Title G1000 NXi integration, custom liveries, and sounds by Boris Audio Works. Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! The developers welcome everyone to join their Discord for further info.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently released their rendition of Campo Grande International Airport (SBCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, with a yearly average of 1.5 million passengers. The airport started as a single concrete runway in 1953, and the passenger terminal was built a decade later, which counts as its official inauguration. Three years later, in 1967, an apron (military and civilian) was built. Twelve years after its inauguration, the apron had to be expanded to keep up with the traffic boom of the 1970s. That is also when INFRAERO first took charge of the airport, investing heavily in expansion work and overall infrastructure improvements.Â  In the 1980s, the terminal was first expanded from 1,500 square meters to 5,000.Â  In 1998, the passenger terminal got its first international section, increasing its area from 5,000 square meters to 6,082.Â  It was expanded again very recently, with 7,215 square meters, a new external look, and under a new concession: AENA won the rights to manage the airport for the next 30 years in 2022. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, landside buildings, PBR textures, custom night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ GearDown StoreÂ for roughly $10. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios has recently released their rendition of Chicago Rockford International Airport (KRFD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Rockford and the Chicago metropolitan area with a yearly average of 102,000 passengers. The airport was originally part of a US Army facility called Camp Grant. It was established in 1917 and functioned until 1946, when it was transferred to the Greater Rockford Airport Authority, marking its official inauguration as a civilian airport. Terminal construction work started eight years after the transfer, in 1954. The current passenger terminal was built in 1987, and its two first cargo facilities were constructed in the mid-90s by the United Postal Service. While the cargo operations were thriving, scheduled passenger services were never its forte, ceasing in 2001. Itâs a UPS hub, handling over 3 billion pounds of cargo annually, making it the 14th busiest cargo airport in the country. Allegiant is the only passenger airline currently serving it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom imagery, custom ground polygon, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR models, 4K textures, accurate dynamic lighting, and LOD optimization. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.54, requiring at least 2.54 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts has recently published a development update covering what they have been working on recently, which includes a brand-new aircraft, an upcoming e-Jets update, and a surprise project. â The Lineage 1000, the highlight of the dev update, has gotten new WIP previews, showcasing the work on the cabin, which has now reached â1.0â, meaning they have finished creating and UV mapping all the parts, with texturing work being the next step ahead. The E-Jets Update 1.1.0 will bring many new features, including FMS Speed, meaning the speeds will change automatically based on the phase of the flight without any user input. It will also include the steep approach system for the E170 and E190, allowing simmers to fly into airports such as London City accurately.Â  It also brings new pop-up screens for the PFD, MFD, and EICAS, working like the FMS and EFB, with the possibility to lock, unlock, resize, and interact by scrolling over the numbers on the screen. X-Plane 12 E-Jet pilots will also get a flight model update, which aims to bring the performance figures closer to real life, along with autopilot and autothrottle adjustments. They have also mentioned a free surprise project, which is yet to be announced (within weeks). The E-Jets are available on theirÂ websiteÂ for $74.95/$134.95 (single variant and complete package, respectively). Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of TromsÃ¸ Airport (ENTC) for X-Plane 12, serving the municipality of TromsÃ¸ with a yearly average of 2 million passengers. It opened in 1964, replacing a water aerodrome that used to be TromsÃ¸âs âairport.â It quickly became WiderÃ¸eâs primary hub for their regional flights to Finnmark and an important domestic destination for SAS, Braathens SAFE, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Within a decade of its inauguration, the original terminal was already suffering from overcapacity, leading to the construction of a new passenger terminal in 1977. It still exists as terminal B and was renovated for the first time in the late 1980s. Terminal A opened in 1997 with three jet bridges and was built exclusively for jets, ârelegatingâ the old terminal to regional and international services. Aegean Airlines, Air France, Austrian Airlines, DAT, Edelweiss Air, Eurowings, Finnair, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Transavia, WiderÃ¸e, and Wizz Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with revised lighting (it was ported from X-Plane 11), custom ground textures, PBR textures, weather effects for wet, snow, and ice, reworked autogen, custom vegetation placement, a fully XP12 compliant mesh, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ Aerosoft StoreÂ for roughly $16.38, requiring at least 1.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of Helgoland Airfield (EDXH) for X-Plane 12, serving the small archipelago of Heligoland in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.Â  It was originally constructed as a military airfield during World War 2 and entirely rebuilt in 1962. The layout has remained the same to this day. With its longest runway being less than 500 meters long, itâs only licensed for aircraft up to 5,700 kilograms, limiting the variety of potential visitors. The length and the often harsh weather (winds) imply special preparation from the pilots, and pilot training is mandatory for commercial service. Itâs served by OFD, flying passengers to Heide-BÃ¼sum, Nordholz-Spieka, and Uetersen. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airfield, with revised lighting (it was ported from X-Plane 11), custom ground textures, adjusted PBR reflections, weather effects for wet, snow, and ice, full support for native XP12 seasons, a full XP12 compliant mesh, and more. Itâs available on theÂ Aerosoft ShopÂ for roughly $20, requiring at least 4.7 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Chudoba Design has recently released their rendition of Bratislava Airport (LZIB) for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12, serving Bratislava, in Slovakia, and Vienna, in Austria, with a yearly average of 1.8 million passengers. Construction work started in 1948, and the airport was inaugurated in 1951. It replaced the old Bratislava Airport in Vajnory, which is 3 kilometers away and no longer exists. With the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bratislava Airport lost most of its traffic to the nearby Vienna International Airport due to lower prices and higher flight availability, but the advent and popularization of low-cost carriers led to Bratislava becoming an important LCC hub for Ryanair and Wizz Air. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, performance-friendly optimization, custom buildings and objects, and full X-Plane 12 compatibility. Itâs available onÂ Chudobaâs websiteÂ for roughly $12.83. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The airport dates back to 1898, when the Signal Corps of the US Army was stationed there, building what would become Olmsted Field and having its first planes landing in 1918. It was used almost exclusively for military purposes up until 1969 when the Middletown Air Depot closed, and airline flights moved from the nearby Capital City Airport to Olmstead State Airport, renamed Harrisburg International Airport in 1973, which was also when the passenger terminal reached full completion, designed by architect William Pereira. Thirty-one years after the passenger terminalâs inauguration, a new 360,000 square-foot terminal was built, costing around $120 million and designed by the Sheward Partnership. Allegiant, American, American Eagle, Delta, Delta Connection, Frontier, United, and United Express serve it, connecting the city to their most prominent hubs. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed, up-to-date buildings, high-resolution ground textures, PBR normal maps, realistically drawn wear and tear and dirt, SAM jetways, custom night lighting, and more. Thereâs no information on the pricing and release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has published the first development update since the variant reveal of their upcoming 777 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with information on 737 updates for the marketplace version and a brand new 777 preview image (which is the cover of this article). Their 737 lineup is finally version matched across all platforms, all on 3.00.0091, the update which brings many memory improvements that significantly impact the productâs overall stability. That also means the Xbox version finally features the Ultimate Flight Tablet, albeit with some limitations: the data entry requires a keyboard to function, as the on-screen keyboard does not transmit data into the simulator in a way that the keystrokes could be captured by the add-on, which makes filling out the fields an impossibility.  They will be working on implementing a functional on-screen keyboard, but the turn-around time for beta builds on console is prolonged, which makes the experimenting take a lot longer than it would on PC. For now, having a keyboard attached to the console is the only way to interact with the tablet appropriately. As they have been busy with the 777 development, the 737 updates have halted, but they will pick it back up once the 777 is released. Updates will come if SU15 introduces any change that could break the 737 family. The 777-300ER is going through the final stage of development, where they ensure everything is polished and working accordingly. Randazzo even says they could theoretically launch the plane as it is right now, and people would be overwhelmingly happy with it. Still, they want to ensure everything is perfect before pushing the button.  They are working on getting the modern navdata conversion into beta testing, along with the lateral path guidance improvements made possible by Navigraphâs current format.  The 737 family can be found on their website or in the MSFS Marketplace, and the price ranges from $34.99 to $69.99, depending on the variant. The pricing for the upcoming 777-300ER has not yet been revealed.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
