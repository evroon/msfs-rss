    <title>Digital Design Releases St. Petersburg Pulkovo Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Digital Design has recently released their rendition of Saint Petersburg Pulkovo Airport (ULLI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving the city of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast, it had more than 18,000,000 passenger operations and more than 144,000 aircraft movements, making it the 4th busiest airport in Russia.Â  After a year and 6 months of construction, the Shosseynaya Airport (named after a nearby railway station) was opened on 6th June 1932. The first flights to this airport carried passengers and mail from Moscow. Soon after, the airport had scheduled flights to four other regional airports. During WWII, the Shosseynaya Airport was at the front line during the Siege of Leningrad. It took more than 3 years after the war for the airport to be fully repaired, and the scheduled passenger service between Moscow and Leningrad was resumed.Â  In the mid-1950s, a new extended runway was built and the airport could handle larger aircraft such as Ilyushin Il-18 and Tupolev Tu-104. The early 1960s brought AN-24 and Yak-40 to the airport, and flights to Vladivostok also started to emerge. By the late 1960s, more than 60 airlines offered flights to and from Leningrad Airport. In 1973, the airport was renamed Pulkovo Airport, and the new passenger terminals were opened. In 1990, Pulkovo reached the passenger traffic rate of over 10,000,000 passengers. Unfortunately, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of passengers rapidly declined.Â  In 2007, new terminal expansion projects began, and since then, the Pulkovo Airport has seen a constant rise in passenger operations (with an exception in 2020 due to COVID).Â  The Pulkovo Airport is the hub for Rossiya Airlines, Nordwind, Pobeda, Smartavia, and Ural Airlines, and a destination for over 50 airlines flying to 168 destinations across Europe, Africa and Asia.Â  Digital Designâs rendition of Pulkovo airport features highly detailed airport objects including interior terminals, custom animated GSE, custom GSX profile, customised jetways, accurate terrain and runway profiles, custom areal imagery, realistic dynamic lighting, St. Petersburg major landmarks, custom helipad at Gazprom Arena, custom animated yachts and boats near the coastline and compatibility with free St. Petersburg landmarks by SkySorceress. This scenery is available for purchase on SimMarket for roughly 21.50 $ and requires at least 4.10GB of free disk space.Â  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Canadian Flight Sim Studios has released their rendition of Kingston Norman Rogers Airport (CYGK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving Kingston (not to be confused with the Jamaican capital!) and the metropolitan area of Ontario. Located 5 miles west of downtown Ontario, it is the largest airport in the area and had 70,000 passenger operations in 2019.Â  During the WWII, an airfield near Kingston was built for training purposes. In 1942, it began serving as a training station for T-6 Texan and Fairey Battle. In 1953, a Naval Air Squadron was formed, using C-45D Expeditor (military version of Beechcraft Model 18) and T-6 Texans, operating from Kingston Airport until 1959 when the unit was disbanded.Â  In 1972, the city took control of the airport and extended two runways, while the third runway (12/30) was decommissioned and turned into a taxiway. Runway 01/19 also saw further expansion as it was extended to 6,000ft, while the terminal was expanded in order to accommodate Q-400 and B737.Â  Today, Kingston Airport is served by Air Canada, FlyGTA and Pascan Aviation, while SkyLink Express offers cargo flights between Kingston and Hamilton. Canadian Flight Sim Studios rendition of Kingston Norman Rogers Airport features custom animated objects, accurate airport layout, accurate ground texture and weather effects, enhanced night environment, dynamic lighting and weather effects and optimised performance.Â  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and high-quality reviews! â</summary>

    <title>Orbx Previews Melbourne Airport for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2024-09-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/oxymml"/>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has recently published previews of their upcoming rendition of Melbourne Airport for X-Plane 12. Serving the city of Melbourne, it had more than 30,500,000 passenger operations in 2023 and more than 215,000 aircraft movements, making it the second busiest airport in Australia. In May 1957, plans for making a new airport near Melbourne were announced. Thirteen years later, the Melbourne International Airport was opened, ending Melbourne Essendonâs 20 years of being an international airport for Melbourne. During the first year of operation, Melbourne Airport handled 155,275 passengers and six international airlines. During the late 1980s, the Australian Government formed the Federal Airport Commission and placed Melbourne Intlâ Airport under their control along with 21 other airports. The first major updates were carried out at the domestic terminals, while the other upgrade included a new three-story concourse equipped with 10 jet bridges.Â  However, in 1994, all FAC-operated airports would be privatised in several phases. This included Melbourne International Airport as well and since then, it has been under the control of Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. Since the privatisation, further improvements to the infrastructure were completed, such as expansions to the runways, terminals, and car parks. In 2005, the airport underwent construction to prepare for the arrival of the Airbus A380. This included widening the main runway by nearly 50ft, construction of dual jetbridges, as well as extension of the terminal building.Â  Today, more than 40 airlines offer passenger flights to Melbourne to over 120 destinations on four continents. Melbourne also receives a significant amount of cargo flights, as 8 cargo airlines serve Melbourne with regular scheduled cargo flights to 21 destinations.Â  Orbxâs rendition of Melbourne International Airport will feature high-resolution imagery, updated airport layout, SAM and OpenSAM custom animated jetways, dynamic lighting, animated 3D vegetation, detailed terminal interiors and control tower interiors, and custom ground polygons with detailed markings.

    <title>Everything New About FS24: The Threshold Rundown</title>
    <updated>2024-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fs24tr"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66ec7fff22729782e85cd48b_ezgif-2-c4a4590944.avif"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft and Asobo have recently announced a plethora of new details about the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, including opening pre-orders for the new sim. They are very confident about the new game, calling FS24 the âMost Ambitious Flight Sim Everâ. âOne of the flagship features coming to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is the new career system. Microsoft says that their system âmimics the experience of how real-world pilots start their aviation careersâ. In the new simulator, users will be able to pick an airport to start their training journey at, and meet a mentor. The training will start out with the basics of flight in a smaller aircraft, and then users will be able to go through a certification tree for different aircraft plus specialties for things like airliner flying, firefighting, search and rescue, and more.  Performance on those missions will give the user experience and credits, which can be saved to eventually buy aircraft and manage a fleet, which will be affected by how aircraft are flown. According to Microsoft, âevery landing, every bump on the runway, is going to impact the warranty of your planes, affecting the cost to keep them maintainedâ.  âThe full list of aircraft that will be included at release has also been revealed. Some notable additions include the Boeing 737 MAX8, Northrup Grumman A-10C II, Airbus A321LR, and the Airship Industries A600. Included in the Standard Edition are many of the default aircraft from MSFS 2020 upgraded for FS24, as well as 30 new aircraft, bringing the total to 70 aircraft. The Deluxe Edition adds another 10 aircraft, with 5 more new with FS24. Premium Deluxe gives users 15 more aircraft on top of the standard and deluxe versions bringing the total to 95, with 10 new with FS24, including aircraft such as the Boeing Dreamlifter, Saab 340, and Boeing C17 Globemaster III. (For a more in-depth breakdown on the categories that you can buy, check the âPre-Ordersâ section below.) Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is slated to include many new technological improvements. First and foremost, they are introducing a cloud-focused âthin clientâ. Much more data will be streamed over the internet including all Marketplace content, reducing overall installation size, which was a very common complaint about MSFS 2020. Microsoft claims that the base installation size will be around 30 gigabytes, which makes for more than a tenfold decrease from the previous simulator. Asobo Co-Founder and CEO Sebastian Wloch explains further that they have âintegrated everything into the cloud, and it is all streamed and kept into a rolling cache on the hardware. You donât have to install any new World Updates; theyâre just streamed seamlessly.â  Another major addition is the Electronic Flight Bag built by the team at Working Title. It will be accessible from the aircraft as well as the main menu, giving users a more powerful tool for flight planning, integrated charts, and weight and balance management. Some other features include a revamped UI, first person mode, overhauled weather and seasons, âsoft bodyâ physics simulation, simulation of every glider port and all maritime traffic, new AI traffic, new photogrammetry, wake turbulence, and much more.  The Marketplace is also going to receive many significant changes in the new sim. One of the most requested features was to overhaul the rating system. The new system will include different ratings for different aspects of a product, such as visual fidelity, system depth, and more. All of those ratings are combined to an overall rating, but users are able to see both the aggregate score as well as the individual categories. Microsoft will also be introducing a rental period for products on the Marketplace. Users will be able to rent some products for a certain period of time for a fee, the price of which depends on how long the rental period is. If the user decides to purchase the product some time after purchasing the rental, the user will only have to pay the difference between the full product price and the rental fee. At the time of writing, Microsoft has not specified how long that period will be. This rental practice will be implemented into all Microsoft products on the Marketplace, but third-party developers will have to opt in to make this available for their products.  If a user owns any Marketplace content from MSFS 2020, it will be brought to FS24, with limited exceptions for addons that may not be compatible with FS24.  FS24 will also include gifting products and virtual currency to friends, provided that users know the recipientâs Xbox Gamertag.  Microsoft has opened up pre-orders for the new simulator today, with 4 editions being available for purchase. Like MSFS 2020 before it, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will have the Standard, Deluxe, and Premium Deluxe editions, but Microsoft is introducing a new tier with FS24, the âAviator Editionâ. The Aviator Edition will come with everything included in the Premium Deluxe Edition, as well as all 30 of the Microsoft-published Marketplace aircraft released from 2021 to 2024. There is also a new limited physical âCollectorâs Editionâ for sale at the Aerosoft Store priced at $259.99 before tax and shipping, which will come with the Aviator Edition of FS24 plus other physical goodies exclusive to the Collectorâs Edition, which weâve listed in full below. Hereâs a detailed breakdown on what each edition will include (all prices in USD):  At the time of writing, Microsoft has not specified what the list of handcrafted airports included in FS24 will be. You can pre-order FS24 at the Microsoft Store. All pre-orders will come with the De Havilland Canada CL-415 firefighting aircraft to fly in MSFS 2020. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will have major impacts for the hobby, the extent of which is still yet to be seen. As new information comes out about the new entrant in the Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise, Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned for that and for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Jetstream Designs has just released its highly anticipated version of Geneva Airport (LSGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Swiss city of Geneva and is the second busiest airport in Switzerland, after Zurich Airport. Annually, the airport welcomes around 16.5 million passengers. The airport opened in 1919 as a small airfield in the area of Cointrin, just outside of Geneva. It wasn't until 1937 that the airport got its first concrete runway. Throughout the Second World War, the airport received various expansions. The first terminal was ready for use in 1946. On multiple occasions, the runway has been further expanded. Today, the airport has two passenger terminals and one Business Aviation Terminal. It serves as a hub for Swiss International Air Lines and is an operating base for easyJet Switzerland. The airport also serves a variety of other airlines from all over the world, serving destinations such as New York, Beijing, Dubai, Oslo, Barcelona, and Palma de Mallorca. With around 173.000 aircraft movements yearly, the airport was able to cater to around 16.5 million passengers last year. The recently launched version of Geneva Airport is filled with features, including a highly detailed and accurate representation of the airport, fully functional VDGS, modeled interiors of all terminal buildings, dynamic airside traffic, custom GSX profile, stunning night lighting, and much more. The add-on requires 2.42 GB of storage space and is available on Contrail for approximately $21.23. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Sulphur Creek Ranch for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/orbxsulphr"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66f00acf0de9aa1198cd807c_sulphur.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Sulphur Creek Ranch (ID74) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This private lodge has a rich history - from catering to Hollywood stars in the past to being regularly served by a DC-3 - it now focuses on hunting trips, horseback riding, and wholeheartedly embracing general aviation. The ranchâs project started in 1946 when Doctor Ben Morgan booked a guided trip through the Sawtooth Mountain Range in Idaho, where he mentioned missing the cowboy lifestyle from his childhood, which prompted Pearl Hornback, the guide, to mention a homestead that recently came up for sale, called âParker Ranch.â They soon flew over the ranch, and Dr. Morgan didnât hesitate to buy it before landing at it in person. He intended to transform it into a destination resort for the Hollywood elite, exposing them to a premium Wild West experience, with hunting and fishing trips at a premium. While that was the original intent, most of the visitors preferred to ride horses, mimicking what theyâd seen - or acted - in movies. The infrastructure built to appeal to Hollywood folk involved the construction of nine modern (for the time) lodges with running water, electricity, electric stoves, and freezers. The hydroelectric system built on Blue Moon Creek made that possible. Sulphur Creek Ranch eventually expanded by purchasing another homestead beside it, becoming the âLower Sulphur Creek.â A Johnsonâs Flying Service Douglas DC-3 transported the materials required for its construction out of the nearby McCall Municipal Airport.Â  According to Orbx, the scenery features an accurate rendition of the ranch, with PBR textures, custom vegetation and terraforming, over 100 custom assets, multiple time-triggered occurrences, custom static aircraft, and fire barrels for evening operations. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.25, requiring at least 1.86 GB of free hard disk space to install. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <title>VFlyteair Simulations Releases Piper Twin Comanche for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. VFlyteair Simulations has recently released their rendition of the Piper Twin Comanche PA-30 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, their first product for the new platform after many years of X-Plane add-on development. The PA-30 Twin Comanche is a twin-engined (as the name suggests) monoplane designed and built by Piper Aircraft, Inc. It is, in a nutshell, a PA-24 with two engines, developed to compete with the Cessna 310 and the Beechcraft Baron. It ultimately replaced the PA-23, also known as the Piper Apache, their former two-engine airplane. â The first prototype was converted from the single-engined Comanche (PA-24) by Ed Swearingen, who operated a facility that specialized in modifying production aircraft models. It was given two 160 hp Lycoming IO-320-B1A engines and flew out of San Antonio, Texas, for the first time in 1961. An official prototype was built a year later in Lock Haven (where their factory used to be at the time), and the FAAâs approval was given shortly after in 1963, with the first delivery following only a few months later. VFlyteairâs rendition replicates the analog version of the Twin Comanche, with an eventual update to bring glass panel options from their X-Plane 12 version under consideration for the future. The classic version sports a Century IIB autopilot and TDSSim GTN750Xi compatibility (a GTN750xi and 650xi stack) for improved situational awareness. The feature list includes an accurately modeled PA-30, using real-world aircraft blueprints and comprehensive photographic reference, with 4K texturing, PBR, detailed normal mapping, a truly 3D virtual cockpit, wear and tear on texturing, simulated electrical systems, and 26 different liveries from multiple countries. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $33.39, requiring at least 910.13 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Rotate Releases MD-11 Passenger for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Rotate has just released its highly anticipated passenger configuration of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12. The iconic three-engined passenger aircraft is now available for everyone to take to the skies. The first MD-11 was delivered and entered service with Finnair in December 1990. Although the MD-11 resembled the DC-10, it had significant differences. The MD-11 featured updated engines, a larger wingspan, a higher maximum takeoff weight, an elongated fuselage, a glass cockpit, and most importantly, an extended range. The introduction of a glass cockpit eliminated the need for a flight engineer. In total, 200 MD-11 aircraft were built, including passenger, combi, and freighter versions. Rotate's MD-11 Passenger model is an enhanced version of their previous freighter variant. The passenger variant includes a passenger cabin, specific elements in the cockpit, an air panel, synoptic display, evacuation panel, attendant communication panels, and a load manager designed specifically for the passenger variant. According to the developer, the MD-11 offers in-depth system simulation, realistic flight dynamics, and high-performance features. The newly released Rotate MD-11 Passenger is available at X-Plane.Org Store for $83.95. If you own the Rotate MD-11 Freighter, the discounted price will be $34.95. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
