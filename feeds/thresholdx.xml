    <title>Navigraph Launches Community Survey 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/nv2024"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67cb46b8f96abf8d6d17e6cc_survey2024.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the seventh edition of their FlightSim Community Survey. The Survey asks various questions about preferred platforms, add-ons, use cases, preferences, etc. It provides great insight into the modern flight sim demographic, thus making it easier for the industry to understand what the simmers really want. Unusually, the Survey was delayed until early 2025 so Navigraph could more comprehensively and accurately capture the community's sentiment due to the large number of major releases near the end of last year. Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â  It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilot's license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â  The Survey will run for ten days starting today (March 7), and the results will be published shortly after. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â  Click here to participate in the world's most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued a new update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing further WASM stability, bug fixes, and two new features. Marked by a controversial launchâwith a creator even asking for a refundâupdate v1.0.2 aims to get their ultimate airliner experience back on track with enhanced WASM stability, a substantial amount of bug fixes, and two new features: the A350 MORA (Minimum Off-Route Altitude) implementation and the Secondary Navigation Display, which provides backup navigation should the primary flight management system be unavailable or degraded. They have also made a note on the many community mods that supposedly improve the A350âs flight model: âComments and updates from the community regarding flight model cfgs are mostly irrelevant, or a placebo effect, as they have little to no effect on how the aircraft performs in sim. We have tuned the plane to fly as closely to real life with the support of our technical working group and A350 pilots teamâ, concluded iniBuilds, while also addressing one of the mod files and their direct impact â or lack thereof â on the flight model: Mod File Feature List: â Major Flight Stability Increases (aircraft should feel much heavier on the controls, will be improved on) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Corrected Reference Speeds (Overspeed Limits increased, set to real values) Overspeed and Cruise Mach iniBuilds: Fixed in v1.01Â  Â  Reduced Thrust Multiplier (lower overall thrust output). iniBuilds: Only effects total thrust. Reducing it as indicated will have a negative/unrealistic impact on SRS Â  Increased Ground Friction (initial roll requires thrust increase) iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback.Â  Â  Reduced Elevator Trim Speed (slightly) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler-on Deploy timing (mostly in-flight, the spoilers seem unaffected) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Can be adjusted slightly in cfgâs but this is not realistic.Â  Â  Custom Flight Dynamics Overhaul. iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Flare and Rotation Behavior (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler Deployment (looking into this, may not be needed after V1.0.1). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Fuel Flow Scalar (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Climb-Lift Ratios. iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback. Â  Brake Changes (higher priority, looking into this also). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  â The complete changelog for the update is available here.Â  The A350 Airliner is available for purchase at the iniBuilds Store for roughly $76.16, requiring at least 10.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>SimPixel Releases Weeze Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimPixel has recently released their rendition of Weeze Airport (EDLV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Kreis Kleve (Germany) and Nijmegen (Netherlands) with a yearly average of a million passengers. It was built on top of a preexisting military facility (RAF Laarbruch) and started operating as a civilian airport in 2003. The airportâs name was supposed to be after the city of DÃ¼sseldorf, but it was ruled out due to the distance (83 km) and the fact DÃ¼sseldorf already had two international airports in close proximity (DÃ¼sseldorf Airport and Cologne-Bonn). The name idea was eventually ruled out by the court in 2016 due to the huge potential to mislead passengers. Ryanair still refers to it as DÃ¼sseldorf-Weeze, though. Itâs an operating base for Ryanair, and Sky Express serves it seasonally. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution textures, custom 3d models, dynamic night lighting, detailed interiors, performance-friendly optimization, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $13.02, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Nuuk Airport (BGGH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Nuuk, Greenland, and has a yearly average of 69,324 passengers. The airport was built in 1979 when the government decided to create a network of STOL-capable domestic airports. It originally featured a 950-meter-long asphalt runway located 86 meters above sea level. The terminal and apron were built on a leveled platform on an undulating slope under a mountain.Â  After many years of expansion proposals, the administration decided to expand the runway to 2,200 meters, build a new terminal to accommodate the expected passenger traffic figures, and expand the apron and service buildings. Construction started in 2019 and reached partial completion in 2022. The new terminal was only inaugurated two years later, in 2024. The scenery accurately depicts the airport, including its new terminal, the 2,200-meter-long runway, handcrafted terrain elevation, detailed 3D terminal with a custom interior, animated objects, custom ground service equipment, up-to-date ground layout, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $16.82, requiring at least 747.95 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Not long after the release of Sim Update 1, the team at Microsoft has launched the in-sim Marketplace for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This Marketplace has been highly anticipated by the community and is now accessible within the simulator. Many items from the Marketplace in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 have been ported to the new simulator. These items should be available in the library and need to be activated. However, content created by Microsoft and Asobo is automatically activated. The Marketplace offers a variety of options. Ported content from the 2020 version to 2024 is marked with a small logo indicating that it is ported. Content upgraded to the 2024 version may have a new price or be available as a free upgrade, and it is also indicated with a logo showing that it has been upgraded. Users can purchase content using Simverse Coins, which is an in-sim currency that can be bought either in the Marketplace or at select retailers. Currently, the Marketplace does not support rentals or gifting, but these features are expected to be introduced with Sim Update 2 in April. Additionally, there are a few known issues with the Marketplace. For the full release notes and details on these issues, please check the official release announcement. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft recently released a new World Update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, which enhances half the landmass of South America with detailed coverage of Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.Â  They partnered with Bing Maps, Maxar, and Vexcel to craft the update, which features sights ranging from vast dune fields to bustling metropolises. Fusing several types of recent geospatial data, including aerial photographs, satellite imagery, DEM (digital elevation model) data, and DTM (digital terrain model), they managed to concoct a very realistic rendition in real-time. It captures 75 Points of Interest in total, including Fort Diamant in French Guiana, Monte Roraima in Guyana and Brazil, and Brazilâs Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. It also includes four TIN cities, all in Brazil: Brasilia, Ouro Preto, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo.Â  Gaya Simulations â one of their partners â crafted seven airports: Foz do IguaÃ§u International Airport (SBFI), Fernando de Noronha Airport (SBFN), Santos Dumont (SBRJ), and Santarem - Maestro Wilson Fonseca International Airport (SBSN); Guyanaâs Kaieteur International Airport (SYKA), Surinameâs Zorg en Hoop Airport (SMZO), and French Guianaâs Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni Airport (SOOM). The update also includes three discovery flights, three landing challenges, and three bush trips.Â  New MSFS 2024-only content will be added on March 17th, including a helicopter landing challenge at Mirante Dona Marta (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), a rally race through Rio in an F/A-18, and a low-altitude challenge in an L-39 through the Serra do Corvo Branco, a rugged mountain range in southern Brazil. The update is free for all Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 owners. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Meridian GMT Announces Brand; Product Announcement</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/meri25"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d1913052f024653fd52772_meridian%20banner.jpeg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The world of flight simulation hardware welcomes a significant new player today - Meridian GMT. At the helm is Nicki Repenning, a name long familiar to the simulation community through his former role as founder and public face of Honeycomb Aeronautical. While Repenningâs earlier work helped establish some of the most widely adopted peripherals in the sector, Meridian GMT is attempting a distinct break from the past - a clean-slate approach grounded in new principles, or rather, on their terms. Repenning played a central role in bringing to life the Honeycomb Alpha Flight Controls, Bravo Throttle Quadrant, and Charlie Rudder Pedals - devices that saw widespread acclaim for their feature set and accessibility. However, Honeycombâs legacy is not without complications. Despite its disruptive design, price point, and popularity, the Bravo Throttle faced recurring quality concerns, such as cable issues and mechanical wear, which were highlighted in long-term user experiences. Furthermore, the very protracted delivery timeline for the Charlie Rudder Pedals and the outright conflict between Repenning and his former business partner Mike Steup from Snakebyte Group, a German product development company, over the ownership and direction of Honeycomb, left a permanent mark on the brandâs reputation. That conflict was central to the community's growing distrust towards Repenning and the Honeycomb name. These challenges were not unnoticed. Community discourse and critical media coverage, including our own reporting at Threshold, explored the implications of Honeycombâs faltering transparency and logistical setbacks. Our piece "Into the Hive: Updates on Honeycomb's Journey", we provided a deep dive into the frustrations voiced by customers and the broader lessons for hardware developers in the flight sim industry. It should be noted that while Honeycomb eventually fulfilled the Charlie pre-orders, the extended wait, poor support, and surrounding controversy left the brand tainted in the eyes of many. Today, however, marks a turning point. Meridian GMT positions itself not as a continuation of Honeycomb but as a new venture with its own values, structure, and trajectory. While Repenningâs experience is undeniable, Meridian is shaped by a conscious intent to move beyond prior missteps. A more modular design philosophy, increased repairability, a tighter internal team, and strategic outsourcing of non-core competencies reflect this new direction. The companyâs first product presentation will take place this coming weekend. Repenning will take the stage at FSWeekend and reveal three hardware products that aim to set new standards across their respective categories. Until then, the full product lineup remains under wraps. As stated in Meridian GMTâs official press release today on their website. "Meridian GMT is more than just a brand; it's a commitment to the flight simulation community", said Repenning. âOur core values - innovation, precision, durability, and affordability - are at the heart of everything we do. Our mission is to deliver hardware that not only exceeds the expectations of the community but also makes products for the casual flight simmer, embarking on their first solo flight, and bring immersion and fun to their experience too". The brandâs identity is also symbolically constructed. Meridian says the logo reflects its mission: three diamonds representing Community, Industry Partnerships, and Innovation, set within a golden hexagon signifying Legacy. The inverted Y in the logo nods to aviation roots, with a subtle aircraft silhouette formed by the space between the diamonds. While the past casts a long shadow, Meridian GMT is determined to navigate new horizons - without relying on nostalgia or name recognition to carry its message. Â Instead, they hope to enter the market with clear eyes, tempered expectations, and a commitment to better serve the simulation community. The brandâs story begins hereâand what follows will be watched with interest. </summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently rolled out a new update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, aiming to mitigate WASM crash issues and aid overall stability. Update 1.0.3 focuses on making the product more stable and less vulnerable to WASM crashes that have plagued the product since its release, sparking a lot of controversy around many online flight sim communities. They have discovered that the update rates between third-party services and the A350âs systems sometimes donât align, inducing issues, and specific data exchanges may cause unexpected increases in memory usage, leading to potential crashes.Â  To further illustrate what has been going on with their A350, iniBuilds decided to provide an in-depth explanation of how the WASM system works and why it may, at times, stop working: it needs memory to run the avionics, custom systems, and other third-party add-ons, which isnât random access memory, but its very own virtual memory running separately inside the simulator, which is allocated according to the demand, and allocation issues may happen, leading to a WASM crash (that either entirely kills the simulator or freezes the airplaneâs system). They have switched their method of handling that by going from manually managing memory to smart pointers, which helps prevent memory leaks and automatically handles freeing up memory when itâs no longer needed. Furthermore, they have taken steps to avoid using unnecessary copy constructors, which lead to high memory usage and performance issues.Â  iniBuilds has also implemented a delay to third-party data requests. Previously, they requested data at 30 fps, which overwhelmed the WASM environment. Now, it only polls it once every second, reducing the memory and processing overhead. The expected benefits of the above measures are fewer crashes due to bad memory management, more efficient memory use in the WASM environment, and better performance and smoothness.Â  The A350 Airliner is available for purchase at the iniBuilds Store for roughly $76.16, requiring at least 10.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Drzewiecki Design recently released their rendition of Chicago Midway International Airport (KMDW) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the Chicago Metropolitan Area and has a yearly average of 22 million passengers. Established in 1927, Midway was Chicagoâs main airport until the advent of OâHare International in 1944. This did not stop it from being one of the busiest airports in the nation.Â  It is an operating base for Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Allegiant Air, Avelo Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Porter Airlines, and Volaris also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, high-quality 3D models, PBR materials, custom animated jetways, VDGS, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.64, requiring at least 1.73 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has recently released the Fokker F28 Professional Version 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This version brings many significant upgrades over the first version, such as a new flight management system (UNS-1), new cockpit equipment, boarding/refueling simulation, and more. The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined regional jet developed in the late 60s. Its first flight was in 1967 and its introduction happened in 1969, with 241 units built after a 20-year run (production ended in 1987). Multiple variants were developed, with the F28-1000 seating up to 70 passengers, the F28-2000 housing 79 people, and the later revision, the F28-4000, featuring quieter engines (Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H), a redesigned cockpit and modified wings, and increased seating (up to 85 passengers). It was then superseded by the Fokker 70 and 100.Â  As of 2019, there are no current operators of the F28 around, with Fly-SAX being the last to operate it commercially. Garuda Indonesia was the largest former operator, with 62 of them. Other Major operators include the Ansett Group (13), AirQuarius Aviation (4), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). The Ansett Group was also responsible for the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, between Perth and Kununurra, roughly 2300 km apart.Â  Version two of the F28 ensures compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It adds many new features to the product, further enriching its realism, such as the new UNS-1 flight management system, new cockpit equipment, boarding and refueling simulation, and more. Please refer to this page for further information on all the features included.Â  Itâs available in their store for $50.39 (a promotional price to celebrate the new update). V1 owners are entitled to a free upgrade. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Atelic has recently released their rendition of Kos International Airport (LGKO) forÂ Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Kos Island, Greece, and has a yearly average of 2.8 million passengers. It opened in early 1964, and the first expansion work was carried out within a decade, bringing the runway to 2,400m and thus enabling it to accommodate larger jet aircraft. The ever-increasing passenger traffic figures led to the construction of a new passenger terminal in 1980, which underwent renovation and expansion seventeen years later. Upon winning the airportâs concession in late 2015, Fraport was heavily committed to improving the infrastructure through heavy maintenance and upgrades and ensuring it was within the safety regulations. Itâs a focus airport for Aegean Airlines and seasonally served by Aer Lingus, airBaltic, Air Serbia, Austrian Airways, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Condor, Discover Airlines, easyJet, Enter Air, Eurowings, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Swiss, Transavia, TUI (multiple), and Wizz Air. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality PBR textures, realistic night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, detailed terminal and tower interiors, realistic terrain profile, custom vegetation, custom roads, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.32, requiring at least 2.37 GB of free hard disk space to install.
