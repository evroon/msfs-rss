    <title>Vref Simulations Announces Guarulhos International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/661763efd36cec2f33c8e941_guarulhos1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Vref Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's set to release tomorrow (11/04) for $8.99. Further information can be found on Vref'sÂ Discord. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Serving the Mexican city of MÃ©rida, the airport has a yearly average of around 3.67 million passengers. The airport is located 3.1 miles (5 km) southwest of the city center of MÃ©rida, lying in the famous State of YucatÃ¡n. MÃ©rida International Airport was established in 1929, when Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n began flying the Ford Trimotor to and from the airport. In 1964, the airport was acquired by the Mexican government and underwent a massive reconstruction in 1968.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released the PNG Highland Bush Strips Pack 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a package with seven challenging airstrips in Papua New Guinea, the toughest country in the world to be a bush pilot. Bush airstrips in Papua New Guinea are generally the only gateway to certain remote villages, meaning itâs vital to their existence and the only way to bring supplies in. The weather is often harsh, the runways are often short and hand-carved, and the challenge is unparalleled. The new pack adds on to the previously released pack (back in October 2023), adding seven new destinations (Sapmanga, Isan, Tep Tep, Bambu, Nankina, Nahu, and Guhu), with well over 100 unique models, PBR texturing, LOD optimization for optimal performance, realistic terrain profiles, vegetation adjustments to facilitate STOL operations, and more. Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.32, requiring at least 2.79 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FLYT Simulations Previews Comte. Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/flyjri"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/661ba016403f08565f28fdb5_jeri1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FLYT Simulations has recently previewed the development progress on their rendition of Comandante Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport (SBJE), serving Jijoca de Jericoacoara, Brazil, with a yearly average of 102,000 passengers as of 2023. Funded by a government plan to develop regional aviation in Brazil, construction work began in 2011 and concluded three years later. The inauguration, though, only happened in 2017 after a series of organizational mishaps.  The passenger terminal, designed by Francisco Antonio Laprovitera Teixeira, consists of a single block with departure and arrivals, food kiosks, bathrooms on each extremity, andânot manyâcheck-in desks.  Its 2200m runway is long enough to accommodate an Airbus A320 and its Boeing counterpart, the 737-800.  Itâs served by Azul (Belo Horizonte), Azul Conecta (Fortaleza, ParnaÃ­ba), Gol Transportes AÃ©reos (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos), and LATAM Brasil (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos). â While there is no information on features, the images showcase special attention to the terminalâs interior. Previously revealed images from earlier this year also point to custom ground textures and realistic clutter. â Itâs said to be releasing in the next few weeks, exclusively on the MSFS Marketplace.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Barelli MSFS Addon Releases Salerno Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/bmaqsr"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/661ba60fe5a7b520a8f1f7d5_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon recently released their version of Salerno Costa d'Amalfi Airport (LIRI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Italian city of Salerno and has been closed for several years due to renovations and upgrades. It is scheduled to reopen in July 2024. The new scenery package from Barelli MSFS Addon features both a 2024 and a proposed 2026 version of Salerno Airport. The Salerno airport was established in 1926 by Italy's Air Force, primarily for flight training. Over the years, the airport underwent several upgrades. However, it wasn't until 2007 that it received check-in desks, boarding areas, luggage belts, and waiting rooms, allowing it to accommodate commercial traffic. In 2011, a project for the airport's further extension and new infrastructure was revealed, leading to its closure in 2016 for construction purposes. After a lengthy period of closure, the airport is set to reopen in July 2024. Airlines such as easyJet and Volotea have already planned numerous domestic and international destinations from Salerno. However, the airport will continue its construction until its completion in 2026. The new scenery package includes custom terminals, custom airport buildings, custom lighting, and much more. It offers two renditions of the airport, the current 2024 version, and the proposed 2026 version. Barelli MSFS Addon has stated that once the final changes for the airport are available, the scenery package will be updated accordingly. The add-on requires 227.11MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.86. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
