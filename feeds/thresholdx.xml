    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has ported its latest version of its landmark simulator, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, onto the PlayStation 5.Â  The full release of the sim for PS5 follows a phased rollout that included early access for those who pre-ordered the Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, or Aviator editions.Â  While the game experience remains the same for PS5 users, Microsoft has noted that access to the in-game marketplace will require a separate app.Â  As a consequence, purchases made in the in-sim marketplace wonât transfer over from other platforms. However, the port does offer more people the chance to take to the virtual skies.Â  Veterans of the PC launch will no doubt take note of Microsoftâs new phased release approach. This approach should hopefully negate the problems faced by simmers just over a year ago, when Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launched on PC and Xbox, leading to vastly increased wait times.Â Â  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 can be purchased from the PlayStation Store on your console. Where do you think the sim will be ported to next? Mac? The Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know!Â Â  For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. In a recent post, VATSIM confirmed that, starting January 1st, 2026, they will require all new users to be at least 16 years of age.  The online air traffic control network claims it is making this change as part of its ongoing work to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all members.Â All current users aged 13 to 15 will be exempted from this policy.Â  While some see the recent changes as a necessary step to maintain the network's safety and security, many others feel that VATSIMâs policy shifts could deter membership growth.Â  How do you feel about the way VATSIM is being run? Does this make you more likely to sign up for VATSIM or maintain your current membership? Or is the organisation becoming a little too restrictive? â Let us know! â For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Just Flight Publishes A300B4 Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. As part of their End of Year Round Up, Just Flight has shared some of the progress on the A300B4 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024, with its exterior artwork nearing completion and ready for showcasing. They have meticulously hand-placed thousands of rivets on every inch of the aircraftâs surface, with the tail area being the most obvious due to its housing of so many critical structures. Special attention has been paid to weathering, resulting in a representation of an airframe that has been in service for many years, complete with streaks of dirt, detritus, traces of rainwater, run-down panels, and more. The flight deck is no different, as they have previously shared. Just Flight considers their A300B4 to be one of the most accurately represented wide-body airliners in any flight simulator. A bold claim, as they note, but they will let the people be the judges. As for the remaining work on the art department, their artist is currently finishing the textures of the landing gear, wheels, and landing gear bays, before eventually focusing on the cargo hold interiors. Once that is out of the way, the artwork will be complete for the A300B4-203 variant. But the -203 isnât the only variant modeled, so thereâs still a bit more work to do: the showcased plane is actually an A300B4-103, for example. A freighter variant will also be included. With that being said, they are not ready yet to show any of the other planned variants. â After the texturing work is complete, they will move on to livery creation for the variants at hand, and they promise to provide a large selection of top-quality work that will represent the A300B4âs diverse range of operators from every habitable continent.  â Furthermore, the developers have finally been able to share previews of the passenger cabin, modelled into a two-class layout from the 1980s, with the First Class cabin featuring 24 seats in a 2+2+2 configuration, and the economy cabin featuring 230 seats in a 2+4+2 configuration, narrowing at the rear to a 2+3+2 configuration. In line with their other products, the cabin will feature numerous simulated elements, offering âlots to play withâ during the cruise phase. The cabin artwork is deemed ready, but there may be minor changes between what has been showcased and the final product at the time of release, most notably related to cabin lighting, as it has not yet been implemented. The flight model is progressing decently, and the extensive data they sourced from a variety of A300B4 variants has been proven rather useful, allowing it to perform as faithfully as possible to the numbers. The systems have now been fully coded, and the plane is getting ready to enter wider beta testing. Among the most recently completed systems, they highlight the Carousel IV-A Inertial Navigation System and the autopilot logic. â Since they have something nearing completion, they can finally begin proper testing with their beta team, allowing them to delve deeply into the system's intricacies to cross-check their functionalities against the aircraftâs FCOM and mitigate any issues that may arise. â Just Flight will be sharing more details earlier next year.

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Releases Katowice Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Katowice Wojciech Korfanty Airport (EPKT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area with a yearly average of 6.4 million passengers, making it the 4th busiest airport in Poland. It was originally built by the Luftwaffe in 1940, with three stone and concrete airstrips of varying lengths. It was used for handling military aircraft flying from Germany, carrying supplies to troops on the Eastern Front. It was also briefly used for aircraft testing in the final phase of World War 2. In 1945, the airfield was taken over by the Soviets, and it was subsequently handed over to Poland in the early 1950s, where it was used to house the Polish Air Forceâs 39th Fighter Regiment. A new runway was built in the mid-1960s, and regular scheduled passenger traffic began in 1966. Polandâs entry into the European Union has substantially accelerated the airportâs growth, with Wizz Air choosing Katowice as its first base outside Hungary. Other low-cost carriers followed suit within the next couple of years. A second terminal was built in 2007 specifically for Schengen flights, and an arrivals-only terminal (Terminal C) followed in 2015. That year also marked the construction of Katowiceâs new runway, which is 3200 meters in length (the second-longest runway in Poland). Itâs a focus city for ASL Airlines Ireland, Buzz (Ryanair), Electra Airways, Enter Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, Ryanair, Skyline Express, Smartwings Poland, and Wizz Air. Air Cairo, Air Dolomiti, Corendon Airlines, Freebird Airlines, Lufthansa, Nesma Airlines, Nouvelair, Pegasus Airlines, Plus Ultra, and Tailwind Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, a custom terminal interior, custom ground service equipment, an accurate runway profile, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $24.62, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently released the long-awaited Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 version of their Boeing 737-800, their first product built natively for the new platform with a lidar-scanned flight deck, improved textures and lighting, new sounds, and much more. Their 738 leverages the capabilities of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to lay the groundwork for a truly native product line that will follow from this (the next variants will gradually roll out over the next months).  â Itâs said to be a significant overhaul of the 737 product line, wholly capitalizing on the simâs capabilities: a new cockpit with new materials, lidar scanned models, new lighting, new surface textures; a new cabin, new interactable items around the airplane, customized door logic, operable cockpit windows, and a new 3D sound-set built by a professional sound engineering team whose lead sound engineer is also a type-rated 737 captain. The full changelog follows below: â Itâs available on PMDG.com for $74.99, and owners of the MSFS 2020 version are entitled to a 60% discount ($30 total).

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released their long-awaited physics-based camera system for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, providing realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, creating unparalleled immersion. For the unfamiliar, ChasePlane was originally released in 2016 for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and later became compatible with Prepar3D, rapidly becoming the de facto camera application for ESP-based simulators at the time. After many years of waiting, Parallel 42 finally managed to break Asoboâs absurdly locked camera system, bringing ChasePlane to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 in early 2025, with the promise of eventually making it 2024 compatible, which has now been fulfilled. â The add-on features highly realistic physics-based camera behavior based on extensive research and real-world pilot footage. This warrants realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, embracing the flight model rather than altering it. Pilots can feel the vibration during the take-off roll, the rush of turbulence, and the fluid shifts during maneuvers. â ChasePlane 2020 owners can upgrade to 2024 for free by using the code âCPWENâ at the checkout page. â Itâs available in their store for $30.00.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In their most recent scenery development recap on their forums, iniBuilds has confirmed that they are working on renditions of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (EGGP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is one of the worldâs busiest airports by aircraft movement, and recreating the complexity and scale of the airport has been quite the task for the iniBuilds team. Development work has been underway for months, ranging from detailed ground poly work to getting the unique architecture of the terminals correct. Greg Jones, iniBuildsâ Head of Scenery and Geospatial Development, says that DFWâs size has been a challenge for the team to adapt their work flow integrating new features.Â  âAdopting MSFS2024 as our core development platform gave us new opportunities to introduce levels of detail and quality previously not possible. â¦ Early in 2025, we had a commercial opportunity to work on Dallas Fort Worth. We jumped at the chance to produce what will be, by far, the largest project weâve ever doneâ, Jones explains. He expands on their goals for DFW, stating that they are putting âperformance at the core of everythingâ and â[The] testing team is hard at work ironing out any kinks, and so far the results have been stellarâ. As of writing, iniBuilds has not confirmed a release date for their rendition of DFW, but they say that users âshouldnât have to wait many more monthsâ for a release. â Following in the footsteps of their recent release of Manchester and Leeds Bradford v2, iniBuildsâ newest UK airport will be Liverpool John Lennon, an airport with a rich history and scenic approach over the river Mersey.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Azrsim has recently released its rendition of Fuzuli International Airport (UBBF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.

It covers an area of just under 650,000 square feet and features a runway that is nearly 10,000 feet long. Currently, the airport is served exclusively by Azerbaijan Airlines, which offers flights to Baku; however, it also accommodates cargo flights. Azrsimâs airport rendition features an accurate airport layout, a fully custom-modelled terminal building, high-quality PBR materials, custom night lighting, and many additional features.
