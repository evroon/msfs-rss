    <summary>Sim: FS24. Middle Asia Developers has recently released their rendition of Tashkent International Airport (UTTT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Tashkent, in Uzbekistan, with a yearly average of 8.7 million passengers, making it the 8th busiest in the Post-Soviet states. The airportâs first records date back to 1924, when the first passenger flight was completed on a Junkers R-13, flying the Tashkent-Pishpek-Almaty route.Â  It eventually evolved into a transportation hub during the Soviet era, embracing the jet age as soon as 1957 with the Tu-104. By 1967, Tashkent had routes to Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Simferopol, certain cities in the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and some in the Far East. â The airport underwent many changes during the post-Soviet era, struggling to cope with the passenger volume. Western construction companies helped out quite significantly during the mid-1990s. Terminal 2 was rebuilt in 2001 to serve over 2 million passengers a year. It has modern waiting lounges, VIP halls, restaurants, bars, duty-free shops, and even a pharmacy. â Terminal 3 was launched a decade after Terminal 2, and it could handle 400 passengers per hour (half the capacity of Terminal 2). â The airport has been expanded in recent years, going from 45,000 square meters to 65,000 square meters of terminal area, allowing it to handle even more passengers per hour. â In August 2024, they finished another expansion project, renovating the airportâs facade while at it. Later that same year, they started expanding the arrivals hall by 2,500 square meters.Â  There are plans to merge the arrival and departure terminals by 2026. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, a basic interior, and much more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.64, requiring at least 984.50 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Impulse Simulations Releases Port Lincoln Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Impulse Simulations has recently released their rendition of Port Lincoln Airport (YPLC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Port Lincoln, South Australia, with a yearly average of 199,546 passengers. The airportâs history dates back to World War 2, when it was established as a Royal Australian Air Force training facility for bomber crews. This laid the groundwork for the infrastructure that would eventually become a civil airport in the not-so-distant future. For nine years after the war, the airport remained closed, only reopening as a civilian airport in 1954. It then had a short grass runway and rudimentary passenger infrastructure. During that time period, Adelaide was the only scheduled destination. Eleven years later, the infrastructure saw major improvements with the sealing of the runway and the construction of a new terminal building, attracting airlines such as ASA (Airlines of South Australia) with their Fokker 27s.Â  The start of the 21st century led to many changes and improvements as the region saw its demand increase with its growth as a tourist destination. A new terminal was inaugurated in 2013, significantly increasing its passenger handling capabilities and bringing modern amenities. QantasLink and Rex Regional Express are the only airlines currently serving Port Lincoln. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an accurate terminal model and its respective interior, custom ground textures, custom terrain and vegetation, high-quality PBR texturing, realistic night lighting, custom orthoimagery, performance-friendly optimization, a custom GSX profile, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.91, requiring at least 996.74 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SHADESCENE has recently released their rendition of Tawau Airport (WBKW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the Tawau Division in Malaysia and has a yearly average of 572,365 passengers. The airport was inaugurated in December 2001, replacing Tawauâs former main airport. It was small and tricky due to its very short runway (one of the shortest in Malaysia), which caused great concern overall.Â  The official inauguration only happened two years later, in 2003.Â  Its passenger terminal has one and a half stories, with two jetways and the ability to accommodate up to 8 airplanes simultaneously. â Before COVID-19, the airport was operating above maximum capacity, reaching 1.8 million passengers yearly, significantly exceeding its intended 1.4 million passenger capacity. A plan was made to expand it to 2.5 million passengers and upgrade the passenger facilities and overall infrastructure. COVID put a halt to the expansion plans, and in 2022, they were still facing the same issue, constantly suffering from congestion. â In 2023, the government allocated a substantial sum for an improvement program, including extra toilets, an enhanced check-in area, an expanded departure lounge, more retail spaces, and more air conditioning units. A year later, a new plan was announced, encompassing a major expansion set to begin in 2025. The expansion will bring the main terminal from 15,800 square meters to 23,500, add eight new check-in counters, and more. The new capacity would remain aligned with the previous project at 2.5 million passengers annually. â AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, and MASwings serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.02, requiring at least 345.46 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has just released an update for Mega Airport Frankfurt for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. While the changelog is brief, this update introduces optimisations that significantly decrease VRAM usage and enhance overall performance. The latest update introduces optimisations for all models, textures, LOD settings, and more. This has allowed for a reduction in VRAM usage of up to 1.6 GB, though most users can expect a slightly smaller decrease. Some users reported performance drops when facing Terminal 2. This issue was caused by the large forest north of the terminal, but it has now been resolved. The team has noted a bug with blurry textures in the scenery, and they are currently working on a patch that is expected to be released by early next week. The updated version of Mega Airport Frankfurt is now available at Aerosoft on sale for $18.41. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has via Discord released an official development update for its 737 MAX product, outlining planned features for the Service Pack 1 update, as well as its plans for the MSFS 2024 platform. The team made it clear that the SP1 content is still in active development, and that the update will not be released within the next three months. Amongst the changes in SP1 are a more âtablet-styleâ electronic flight bag (EFB), rather than the current Boeing OEM unit, accompanied by CPDLC integration via the Hoppie API, with support for online networks, as well as BATC and SayIntentions, also under review. Other planned features include cabin announcements (with and without GSX), the MAX 8-200 variant, with the typeâs Mid-Cabin Emergency Doors modelled, a visual APU model, an expanded main wheel well model, and an updated fuselage model, rivets and other details.  Cabin materials will be redrawn with more texture detail, multiple seating layouts will be offered, and cockpit materials will be refined for better surface type distinction. Landing gear textures will be overhauled, LNAV behaviour will see targeted adjustments, and numerous smaller fixes will be implemented before release. The update also marks a shift in development priorities. SP1 will be the final major release to support MSFS 2020, with all future development moving to MSFS 2024, due to substantial platform differences between the two. Post-SP1 plans include a native MSFS 2024 version of the MAX 9, with the MAX 10 and MAX 7 also under consideration, only after official certification and service entry of those types. While small patches may still arrive for the current MAX 8 for 2020 after SP1, iFlyâs primary focus will be advancing the series for the newer simulator. You can read the full development update on iFly's official Discord server.  For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has released its Beechcraft Baron B55 for MSFS 2024, available exclusively through the in-sim Marketplace. The light twin-engine aircraft arrives as the latest addition to the developerâs growing MSFS 2024 catalogue. The Baron B55 is a light twin, first introduced in 1961, as part of Beechcraftâs Baron family, which evolved from the earlier Travel Air. Production of the 55 series continued until 1983, with 3,651 units built. Powered by two Continental IO-470-L engines, producing 260 horsepower each, the aircraft is capable of cruising at around 190 knots, with a range of more than 900 nautical miles. Its six-seat layout and twin-engine configuration made it a popular choice for both private and training operations. Carenadoâs rendition of the type for MSFS 2024 includes avionics options such as Aspen Avionicsâ EFD1000, or traditional steam gauges, Garmin GNS530 and GNS430 units, with GTN750/650 compatibility, and the Bendix King KFC 225 autopilot. The package also features eight liveries, plus a paint kit, and an EFB with 2024 interfacing, for switching between avionics configurations. Additional systems modelled include a Garmin GMA 340 audio panel, Garmin GTX 330 transponder, weather radar, and fuel flow indicators. The aircraft is also compatible with MSFS 2024âs Career mode out of the box, with support for missions such as ferry flights and charter services. You can read the full feature list of the product below: Features The Carenado Beechcraft Baron B55 is available for purchase now through the MSFS 2024 Marketplace for $24.99.

    <title>Orbx Previews HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta Scenery for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has shared an update of its highly anticipated HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update was posted on its community forum earlier this week. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, this is the third and final planned preview before release. The previews highlight the Delta TechOps area and the airportâs control tower, amongst others. Delta TechOps, also known as Delta TOC, is the largest airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in North America, and has been recreated in the scenery, with 1:1 accuracy. Veneziani stated that âevery pipe, air-conditioning unit, and rooftop elementâ was individually modelled, based on real-world references. While the developer showcased the maintenance complex, he noted that the airside portion of the airport is not yet ready for display, as the ground polygon is still in progress. Remaining work includes cargo buildings on both the north and south sides, taxiway signage, approach lighting, and tunnel detailing, as well as general finishing touches. According to Veneziani, the goal is to release the scenery before Christmas. He noted that development has been underway for nearly two years, with a continued emphasis on quality over timelines. HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport is the worldâs busiest by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, serving as Delta Air Linesâ primary hub. We'll keep you updated on its release. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!
