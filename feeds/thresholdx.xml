    <title>PMDG Publishes New Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777321"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67536d0cda476a2b5d5c3f25_frei5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a new development update with further information on their effort to bring the 777 product line to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in what appears to be a âbig week for 777 testingâ. Their beta team has recently been given access to working beta builds of the 777-300ER, 777-200ER, and 777F for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. PMDG finally feels confident enough in the platform to let their testers try it out without feeling like they would be wasting their time and effort. For those unfamiliar with the saga so far, PMDG was initially somewhat skeptical about Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, not in regards to the platformâs capabilities per se but more so on the compatibility aspect, even though Asobo had promised it would be pretty straightforward to port content over. Their skepticism was proven right over time, and the transition has been anything but smooth, with the first glimmer of hope only showing up with the release of SU1 beta in January 2025. They launched an all-hands effort at the time using undocumented methods and practices for the new platform, ensuring it would not be a merely âhalf-assedâ drag-and-drop port but an actual solid conversion that would last and show their quality. The so-called herculean effort has apparently paid off, and they continue to work hard to ensure it will be stable and compliant in MSFS 2024 on PC and Xbox. â Despite sharing many common elements with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, the new platform has plenty of significant changes that were not documented yet or were partially/wrongly documented, which has contributed to slowing down the process quite substantially. â On top of ensuring compatibility, PMDG has also been hard at work upgrading the 777 product line with new MSFS 2024-only features and further polishing it with hundreds of bug fixes, tweaks, changes to handling characteristics, performance improvements, and a near-full refactor of the sound environment using new recording equipment, new processes, and even collaborating with their coding team to build even more fidelity to the airplaneâs relatively rich sound environment. â The company is excited to be testing the 777 lineup in MSFS 2024 finally (and soon the DC-6, or so they hint), but there is still no release date in mind until they know for sure itâs ready. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their official website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99 If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>iBlueYonder Releases Portland International Airport V2 for MSFS 2020</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pdxv2o"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67ddde94c2dcf4adcd6c94eb_pdx1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iBlueYonder has recently released their upgraded rendition of Portland International Airport (KPDX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, bringing its ground layout and overall infrastructure up to 2025 standards. The airport opened in 1936, replacing Portlandâs Swan Island Municipal Airport, which was deemed too small and impossible to expand due to space constraints. The new project had a much larger area to work with and generated a greatly needed number of jobs, helping many families during the Great Depression.Â  Employing over 1000 workers, the airportâs construction was said to be one of Portlandâs most significant public works improvements during the New Deal era. It was not without its challenges, though: the airportâs low-lying area was highly susceptible to flooding due to its proximity to the Columbia River, which led to the workers having to cover the area with over 4 million cubic yards of sand to help drain the water, along with a series of dikes to keep flooding at bay. By 1941, two runways capable of handling larger commercial aircraft were ready, and it temporarily served as a military airfield for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. A new terminal opened in 1959, still serving as the present facility, albeit heavily upgraded.Â  The terminal was first renovated in the 1980s, ensuring Portland was ready for future needs. Ticketing and baggage claim areas were expanded and renovated, and a new concourse was added in 1986. A full reconstruction of Concourse E in 1992 and the opening of Concourse D in 1994 followed. New concourses (A, B, and C) were inaugurated a day before 9/11, giving its present H-shape. Further terminal expansion was only carried out in the early 2020s (part of it was absent from iBlueYonderâs first rendition). Part of the new expansion work is still ongoing and scheduled to launch in late 2025, but the developer has already brought it to the virtual realm of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Itâs a hub for Alaska Airlines and served by Air Canada Express, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, British Airways, Condor, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Icelandair, JetBlue, KLM, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, Volaris, and WestJet Encore. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, a highly detailed terminal building with full interiors, custom jetways, many new buildings and garages, custom ground service equipment, and a custom GSX Pro profile. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $19.96, requiring at least 3.67 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>iniBuilds Announces London Gatwick Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inilgw"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67dde76ffe85203834ea32a1_lgw.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently announced the development of London Gatwick Airport (EGKK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the Greater London Urban Area and has a yearly average of 40.9 million passengers, making it the second busiest airport in London and the eighth busiest in Europe. â The airport was built in the mid-1950s on top of a preexisting military facility (RAF Gatwick), and its buildings were designed by Yorke Rosenberg Mardall.Â  â On the other hand, RAF Gatwick took over an aerodrome from the 1920s, which had been operating commercially since the 1930s after authorization from the Air Ministry. Its first terminal, the Beehive, was inaugurated in 1935.Â  â The 1990s saw huge upgrades to the airport due to British Airwaysâ decision to build Gatwick as their secondary hub upon acquiring Dan Air, which led to their significant dominance at the turn of the millennium. â Shortly after that, though, British Airways decided to de-hub the airport, which led to the growth of a popular low-cost carrier, easyJet. â Itâs a British Airways hub and an operating base for BA Euro Flyer, easyJet UK, Norse Atlantic UK, TUI Airways, Vueling, and Wizz Air UK. Aegean Airlines, Air China, Air Europa, Air India, Air Transat, airBaltic, Atlantic Airways, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Corendon, Croatia Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airways, Emirates, Ethiopian, Freebird Airlines, Gulf Air, Iberia Express, Icelandair, ITA, JetBlue, Kenya Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Nouvelair, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Ryanair, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, SunExpress, Swiss, TAP Air Portugal, TUI Airways, Turkish Airlines, Volotea, Vueling, and WestJet also serve it. â Thereâs no information on pricing or release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft CRJ owners awaiting the launch of the CRJ v2 will have to wait a little bit longer than first anticipated, as the release has been delayed by one week. Nearly four years after its initial release, the CRJ is receiving a free v2 update, set to feature a remodelled cabin and an improved flight model. However, Aerosoft has decided to push back the update by one week to ensure the best possible experience for users at launch. Originally scheduled for March 25th, the update is now set to launch on April 1st â Benjamin from Aerosoft shared an official statement earlier today: â âWe would like to inform you that the CRJ v2 update has been delayed by one week. The new release date is April 1st. This is to ensure the best possible quality and that the update ships with as few issues as possible, including some you may have seen in the preview streams/videos this weekend. We know you all have been waiting for a long time for this update, but we would rather release a few days later than publish the update in an incomplete state.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix has just posted its 2025 roadmap, detailing planned updates for the current A320 CEO family, compatibility improvements for MSFS 2024, and a new NEO variant. A320 and A321 NEO Announcement The major highlight of the roadmap is the announcement of an all-new A320 and A321 NEO. After extensive research and development, Fenix has created a completely new âNEOâ standard ECAM system from the ground up, which is independent of ProSim. This advancement allows for even deeper system modeling. This is not merely an updated A320 CEO with new engines; it is a fully developed A320 NEO simulation. According to Fenix, the entire aircraft has been rewired, encompassing every sensor and generator. They have also developed a fully functional DRAIMS panel, although visuals are not yet available for display. Both the CFM LEAP engine and the Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan will be fully represented in the simulation. Additionally, the Fenix A320 NEO will be a standalone product, meaning that prior ownership of the A320 CEO family is not a requirement. Upcoming Big Fenix Update Fenix has announced that a major update for the A320 CEO family will be released in a couple of weeks. This update will include the addition of A139 sharklets, the implementation of the Weather Radar, and new landing dynamics that enhance flare and ground effect behavior. Several upgrades to the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will also be introduced, such as support for Lido charts and a improvedV-Speeds calculations. Additionally, there will be audio improvements, including a new 3D AEVC soundscape for the flight deck and a redesigned IAAE V2500 soundset. Fenix says they will provide a full changelog shortly. â For more details on the Fenix A320 NEO and A321 NEO, along with the upcoming big Fenix update, refer to Fenixâs website. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. ST Simulations recently released their rendition of Bovec Airport (LJBO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which serves the municipality of Tolmin in Slovenia. Built in 1962, Bovec is an important airfield in the country. It is located in the Slovenian Julian Alps at an elevation of nearly 1450 feet, which makes it perfect for parachuting events (which are held yearly) and general aviation. Its single 900x40-meter asphalt runway and slightly high elevation make it a great challenge regardless of the size of the airplane. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D models and an up-to-date ground layout. It also offers performance-friendly optimization with MSFS 2024âs new LOD system, a custom hangar with an interior, landside buildings, custom objects, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $10.79, requiring at least 349.29 MB of free hard disk space.

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.2.0 Update</title>
    <updated>2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1222"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67ef0ee9572b607093dd0c18_lgt1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released a major update to X-Plane 12, which brings massive improvements to cloud rendering, lighting, environmental effects, and graphics performance. Their graphics team has been working to mitigate the famed dark cockpit issue, bringing significantly improved interior rendering quality. The light coming into the cockpit correctly follows the aircraft's contours and structural details. Furthermore, the graphics engine's exposure handling has also been improved, bringing exposure fusionâa familiar feature on most modern smartphonesâto the virtual realm of X-Plane 12. It consists of taking multiple photos at various levels of exposure and then automatically stitching them together, yielding a potentially impressive-looking result.Â  The sky brightness has also been tweaked to ensure it's more natural and doesn't burn people's retinas. Ground object brightness values have also been tweaked to ensure they are not overly bright. Their graphics engine as a whole has also undergone changes, with an upgrade to their shader compiler, which manages resources more efficiently and thus brings smoother performance figures. Texture handling has also been tweaked to ensure faster loading times and more efficient rendering. Their VRAM management method has also been tweaked, ensuring it prioritizes smaller memory requests before large ones, aiding total memory allocation. Additionally, it makes multiple attempts to allocate memory before giving up, allowing the system to free up space when needed and ultimately reduce the chances of blurry textures or slow performance overall. The cloud rendering system has also been changed, with a small radius surrounding the camera's viewport sporting high-quality clouds, nearly eliminating cloud pixelation effects around the airplane. They hint at it being a stepping stone to other cool rendering effects in the future. Last but not least, they have also changed how their light rendering system works by breaking them into tiles, yielding better performance in demanding environments such as large airports and cities. In addition, they have also made minor changes to colors, bringing more realistic color accuracy, improved sky rendering, better cloud shadows, cloud shadows on clouds, cloud-aware ambient light, and more realistic shadows overall. Detail has also been enhanced on surface textures around airports, and weather effects now also show outside of the airport's area, accumulating on main roads, as suggested by the community. â The complete changelog follows below: â Known Issues â Fixes and Enhancements General â Graphics â â Scenery â The update is currently available on the public_beta branch on Steam. Laminar customers can get the update by toggling âCheck for new betas as well as updatesâ.
