    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels recently released their rendition of QuÃ©bec City Jean Lesage International Airport (CYQB) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the QuÃ©bec City metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 1.7 million passengers. It was established in 1939 as a military training facility for air observers, with the first flight only taking place two years later, on September 11, 1941. It was then known as RCAF Station LâAncienne-Lorette, and its wartime foundation laid the essential infrastructure (runways, hangars, and control tower) that would eventually be adapted for civil use. Its transition from military to civil use happened when World War 2 ended, with the Department of Transport taking over immediately. Early commercial flights connected QuÃ©bec to other major Canadian cities, fostering economic growth in the region. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased passenger numbers as air travel became more popular, requiring expansion work to accommodate the ever-growing number of people. Furthermore, the beginning of the jet age also demanded slightly longer jetways and aprons. In 2006, the administration invested over 65 million dollars in increasing the terminalâs passenger handling capacity and improving the overall quality of their services. The modernization included a terminal reconfiguration, the enlargement of waiting rooms, and the complete restructuring of the baggage handling area. The process was finished 2 years later, and the airport could now handle up to 1.4 million passengers. It was expanded again in 2011âat a cost of over 200 million dollarsâdoubling the terminalâs size. The project took 6 years to complete and also included a new runway, new taxiways, new deicing pads, and enhanced facilities. â Two years after the conclusion of the terminal expansion, further work was carried out to link the domestic and international terminals. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality models, custom ground markings, custom autogen around the airportâs area, performance-friendly optimization, and X-Plane 12âs weather textures. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.49, requiring at least 931.19 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Taimodels recently released their rendition of QuÃ©bec City Jean Lesage International Airport (CYQB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the QuÃ©bec City metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 1.7 million passengers. It was established in 1939 as a military training facility for air observers, with the first flight only taking place two years later, on September 11, 1941.

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdg713"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/670074421902159c8c578804_randy5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update concerning their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 and provided a concrete release date for its upcoming 777LR.Â  While PMDG was originally planning to push out a series of 777 updates a bit before FSExpo, they claim to have underestimated the amount of work required to prepare for it, ultimately deciding to hold off on pushing the updates until the dust was settled for good, in case something went wrong with the update. â They anticipate Microsoft will push out the 777 lineup update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 sometime next week (777-300ER and 777F only), bringing it up to build 116. Itâs mostly a cleanup update, with no new features per se. The same timeframe applies to the update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 users, which will become free for 2020 version owners. â Â  The 777-200ER, on the other hand, is having issues with Microsoftâs intake process, and itâs unknown whether it will be available next week alongside the other family members.Â  â Build 166 will also be available for PMDG.com customers on Tuesday, marking the first time since the airplanes were released that there is version parity between the marketplace and their own storefront.Â  â The upcoming 777-200LR is undergoing its final testing phase and is scheduled to be released on July 15th. FSExpo has significantly delayed their progress, though, so it might be pushed to the following week. As usual, it will be made available on the website first and then in the marketplace within two weeks, assuming the intake process goes well. â Furthermore, PMDG has publicly addressed some of the questions they heard at FSExpo, where they held their booth for the first time despite being a long-term major sponsor. Along these questions, the 737NG is said to be coming âasapâ to 2024, the 737Max could be coming soon, and PMDG might work on a 787.Â  â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6874609563fcf76ffdc6da39_fifty1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently updated their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing new features, bug fixes, immersive visual improvements, and more. Update v1.1.1 brings the long-awaited Collimated HUD, delivering accurate projection and dynamics right in your eye line, improving situational awareness in any weather. They have also addressed community feedback on the MFDs not being clickable in VR. iniBuilds says this is related to how mouse interaction checks occur per screen, which sometimes fail in VR frame updates. They are still investigating it. Furthermore, some users noted that both cursors disappear when a text box is active, whereas that does not happen IRL. It was a design choice to avoid mouse input conflicts. â The Hydraulic system logic has been fully overhauled, correcting an issue where the outer flaps wouldnât extend when the hydraulics were lost, despite the SD page showing they should. The logic has been reworked and now operates as required. â They also addressed community feedback on the ECAM memo formatting, which they claim to be accurate and based on a realistic MSN configuration and software version they had verified access to. â The visual department has seen tweaks, improving the engine blur with more transitional texture stages for a smoother animation. The metal rendering has also been enhanced, elevating the realism. 2024 users also got improved advanced weathering effects, with dents, taped areas on wings, and more. The window blinds are now visible from the outside. After months of testing, the A350 is a week away from making its debut on Xbox (MSFS 2024 only). It will include the recently released ULR variant but wonât feature the HUD yet (but itâs well underway). The 2020 version is still undergoing testing.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. COWS has unveiled the DA40-NG, a new addition to its growing lineup of general aviation aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The announcement was made in a recent video, posted to the developerâs official YouTube channel. Built on the foundation of the COWS DA40-XLS, the DA40-NG brings a modernised take on Diamond Aircraftâs popular single-engine trainer. The aircraft has been designed in collaboration with real-world DA40 pilots and features a handcrafted flight model. COWS describes the result as an âexceptionally accurateâ simulation of the NGâs handling and performance, particularly well-suited for student training and procedural practice. The DA40-NG introduces several other features and enhancements. These include fully modelled circuit breakers, the Engine Indicating System (EIS), and custom cylinder physics modelling. The developer confirmed that the DA40-NG will be offered free of charge, to all existing DA40-XLS owners. While the initial release will be for MSFS 2020 and 2024, a version for X-Plane 12 is also planned at a later date. Stay tuned for more flight simulation news, right here on Threshold.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Pepelatz Studio has recently released its debut aircraft for XP12, the Yakovlev Yak-55M, a Soviet-era, single-seat aerobatics plane, known for its extreme manoeuvrability. Developed in close collaboration with real-world Yak-55M pilots, the aircraft promises to deliver an authentic flight experience, designed for high-precision aerobatics. Created from scratch, the aircraft includes high-resolution PBR textures, photogrammetry-based geometry, and extensive cockpit detailing. Furthermore, the addon features accurate gauge behaviour and a vibration-simulated instrument panel. The addon gives the option to choose between Cold Start or Automatic Sequential Start, metric or imperial altimeters, and 8.33 or 25 kHz VHF radios. Flight dynamics were tuned with pilot input to reflect accurate behaviour across the entire flight envelope. The addon features a fully modelled M-14P engine, custom fuel, electrical, oil, and pneumatic systems, and includes a functional smoke system with weight impact. Failures and weather-dependent engine startup behaviour are also included.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has recently updated their Accu-Sim Comanche 250 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, focusing primarily on the 2024 port but also making some new changes to the 2020 version.Â  Update v1.6.4 fixes an issue with dark screens on the PMS50 GTN 750 and on the falcon71 KLN 90B GPS units, addresses saved states not being read sometimes, and a series of minor glitches with the 2024 version were also wholly mitigated. The changelog follows below: Furthermore, A2A is running a storewide sale (does not apply to the newly released Aerostar, though), with a 25% discount. It runs for two weeks from July 17.Â  The add-on is available for $37.49 (discounted price) in their store.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Updates 777 Lineup for MSFS 20/24 &amp; 777-200LR Releasing Later Today</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has issued a new update to their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, as mentioned in their previous development update from a few days ago. Furthermore, they have also confirmed the release of their 777-200LR for later today. Build 116 is now available for the 777-300ER, 777F, and 777-200ER via their operations center and marketplace (MSFS 2020 only for now), while the lineup should arrive in 2024's marketplace later today (or show up for people who already own the 2020 version). PMDG also clarifies that the 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is not exactly the same as that of the 2020 version. They have been built using the new SDK and underwent thousands of changes to ensure stability and performance. With the 777 workload easing off, PMDG will now focus on the 737NG for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. A short video of the cockpit door being operated will come soon. â The DC-6, on the other hand, is still depending on an Asobo fix, as it has suffered from an LOD issue since the advent of SU 3. â The 747's development team has gained new hands since the 777 folks are now free, meaning the process might speed up significantly from now on. Both 741 and 744 are in active development, and it's a "close horse race" to see which one will be released first. â The 777-200LR, the last of the 777 variants promised by PMDG, will be released later today. In Randazzo's words, it is the "true long-haul monster of the family." The marketplace release will follow sometime in August. â PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to roughly $78.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK-Studios has revealed Adelaide Airport as its next project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with a release planned for next Friday. The scenery will support both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, with a new, walkable jetway feature reserved for the newer simulator and its walkaround mode.Â  Based on the announcement, the package will include a modelled terminal interior, and extensive detailing across the airport environment. Adelaide Airport is the primary airport serving Adelaide, in South Australia. Located roughly 6 kilometres west of the central business district, it is the countryâs fifth-busiest airport by passenger volume, with over 8.5 million travellers passing through in the 2024 financial year. Adelaide Airport accommodates domestic, international, and general aviation traffic, serving as a hub for Virgin Australia, a focus city for Qantas, and an operating base for Jetstar. The airport was first established in 1955, and operates over 250 flights daily to more than 30 destinations across Oceania, Asia, and North America. Adelaide is also equipped to handle large aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. Additional details are expected in the days leading up to release.

    <title>FSLabs Updates A321ceo &amp; neo for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently issued a new experimental update to their A321ceo and ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, focusing on increasing stability, improving visual performance, and improving the handling, among other things. Update v11.0.1.309 aims to improve performance and lower VRAM usage, ensuring better headroom for users running very high resolutions or rocking cards with little VRAM to spare. Such extra headroom should warrant better stability in video memory-constrained environments, like approaching a demanding airport on top of a photogrammetric area. They have also mitigated certain CTDs that occasionally happen with very specific TCAS traffic situations and aircraft reloads. The steps taken to mitigate those should increase the overall robustness of their code, making it much more reliable. FSLabs has also worked on correcting an issue affecting the yaw behavior during the landing roll and retuning brake effectiveness based on measured stopping distances from real aircraft. These tweaks should bring more authenticity to the post-touchdown phase. â Systems were also improved, with FMGC protections added, further improvements to the NEO engine logic, ROPS behavior, and many smaller fixes.Â  â The complete changelog follows below: AOC Service:Â  â â APU: â â CIDS: â ELAC: â FMGC: â â FWC:Â  â â MCDU: â â Neo-specific: â â ROPS: â â Systems Improvements: â â Model Updates: â â The A321ceo and neo are available in their store for $69.95 each.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. REX Simulations has announced REX Atmos CORE, a new utility meant to enhance the atmospheric environment in MSFS 2024. Building on the previously released REX Atmos 2020, Atmos CORE brings the popular enhancement utility to Microsoftâs new simulator. Atmos CORE enables real-time adjustments of weather, atmospheric rendering, and environmental conditions. According to REX, Atmos CORE will integrate seamlessly with Asobo Live Weather, ActiveSky FS, and other custom or imported weather presets, without interfering with existing simulator files. Improvements over default include more realistic ozone levels, cloud colour accuracy, shader appearance, cloud lighting, Rayleigh scattering, and atmospheric blending. Atmos CORE is described as fully customisable, safe and non-destructive, with a simple user interface. You will be able to alter different atmospheric parameter values directly, with the ability to save and share the changes as presets.Â  A single preview image, shared in the official announcement on the REX website, shows off more natural lighting, and improved cloud shading. No release date or pricing information has been shared yet, though the product is described as being âavailable soon.â â For the latest flight simulation news, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!
