    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a video posted to their YouTube channel, Microsoft has released a launch day development update regarding the situation of the recently released Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Hosted by Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann, Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch, and Xbox Senior Community Manager Jayne Reynolds, the update comes as a response to many users who are experiencing issues while downloading the sim, such as software crashes, long download times, and missing default aircraft. Neumann starts off by stating that they âare really proud in what [sic] weâve accomplished with the simâ and they knew âthe excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024â, but he acknowledges that they underestimated the extent of the excitement for the new sim and that it âhas overwhelmed our infrastructureâ. Wloch says that they âhave been struggling for a few hours with one of our servicesâ and explains that the root cause of the issues has been a cache overflow in their servers. He goes further into detail, saying when âthey [Players] start, they areâ¦asking a server for some data, and that server is going to catch [sic] it in a databaseâ¦and that database is currently getting saturatedâ.  Wloch then describes what they have done to address the issue: âWeâve tried to restart the services, weâve taken measures to throttle the number of people who can come in [download],...and it worked well during [sic] maybe half an hour or so and then all of a sudden, the cache collapsed again so weâre restartingâ¦[and] trying to investigateâ. â Neumann continues by reassuring the community, acknowledging that they know âa lot of people are frustratedâ but they âwant to be as transparent and open as possibleâ, and adds that âthe team is on itâ. Finally, Reynolds concludes by thanking the community for all their feedback and that âWe appreciate each and every one of you, and weâll see you in the skies soonâ. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes New Status Update on MSFS 2024 Product Compatibility </title>
    <updated>2024-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777f24"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67007455f9c93f4f4c4607ef_randy4.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently provided a brief update on the compatibility of their product line with the newly released Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and what to expect next from their projects. As they mentioned during the previous development update from a few days ago, PMDG ran into issues when testing their product lineup on the Developer Alpha build of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 that had been provided to them, leading to more questions than answers.Â  With the simulator now in everyoneâs hands, PMDG is still unable to thoroughly verify the compatibility or lack thereof due to stability issues and access problems with the platform (which affected most day one/two players). They have reached a few conclusions: the 777 will not work in MSFS 2024 without an update, as changes were made to the simulatorâs communications API, leading to memory allocation corruption and eventual instability. The 737 also ran into similar issues, albeit to a lesser extent due to its simplicity as far as communication APIs go. As of earlier today, both products are still under evaluation, but they have not achieved sufficient platform stability to do so efficiently. The DC-6, though, appears to work just fine when pasted into MSFS 2024âs community folder. While their original plan was to provide compatibility in time for the weekend, it appears that expectation is unrealistic, given all the issues they had properly evaluating compatibility. The new timeframe is now âsome weeksâ from now. There is even a level of uncertainty regarding whether they will be able to make it compatible at all, as they are unaware of the amount of work that will be required to make it a reality. The upcoming 777F will be released for MSFS 2020 after all, as the compatibility assessment has proven to be more of a hurdle than initially imagined. Yet, they are cautious because Asobo and not PMDG themselves promised straightforward compatibility between both simulators and so far, they have been unable to gauge that accurately. They must be sure of that compatibility before they launch the product under such expectations. Furthermore, PMDG judges it to be too early to determine when and if native 2024 features will be implemented in the 737 and 777, as they are still undergoing their evaluation process. PMDGâs aircraft lineup is available on their website, with products ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Sherburn-in-Elmet Airfield (EGCJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airfield serves the town of Sherburn in Elmet in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The airfield dates back to the 1920s when the Yorkshire Aeroplane Club was established there. It attracted a substantial number of young folk from the region who would gather to watch airplanes take off and land.Â  A few years later, Sherburn Airfield became Airspeed Ltd's testing grounds for their first aircraft: a glider, the "Tern," launched by a car pulling a steel cable. It became an RAF station during World War 2, housing a naval torpedo aircraft factory.Â  In mid-42, the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment was moved from RAF Ringway (near Manchester) to Sherburn and charged with developing the means to deploy allied airborne forces and supplies during operations. After the war, private pilots and aero clubs have used it for training and leisure. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airfield, with full-detail buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, PBR materials, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $8.44, requiring at least 19.44 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Fly2High has recently released its rendition of Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV) for X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12. The airport serves Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, with a yearly average of 3.9 million passengers. The airport was built in the early 1940s on a 600-acre piece of land near Cherokee Hill, with three 3600-foot runways covering all possible wind options. The US Army Air Corps soon took it over as a bomber and training base for B-24 bombers and fighter aircraft. It was temporarily named Chatham Airfield, and its infrastructure significantly improved during that short period. Post WW2, it was turned over to the Georgia Air National Guard and renamed Travis Field after a late local Brigadier General, victim of a fatal B-29 accident in California. A new airline terminal was built in 1958, and runway extension work followed in 1962, preparing the airport for the jet age. A brand new terminal was built in 1994, with eight gates and expansion possibilities. Five departure gates were dutifully added in 2007.Â  It won #1 Best Domestic Airport two years in a row (2021 and 2022) in Travel+Leisure Worldâs Best Awards. The method was a survey among the readers that took accessibility, shopping, check-in, restaurants, cleanliness, and many other factors into account. The airportâs domestic popularity was also reinforced by CondÃ© Nast Traveler, which ranked it the best in the United States for three years in a row. Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air and served by American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed ground markings, custom taxiway signage, performance-friendly optimization, custom HDR lighting, PBR textures, custom 3D models, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $16.89, requiring at least 2.40 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SiamFlight recently released their rendition of Bang Phra Airfield (VTBT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Due to its surrounding geography, this airfield is one of the most challenging in Thailand. Located about 3 kilometers east of Bang Phra, a small village in Thailand, the airfield is home to the Thai Flying Club, the country's first and oldest club. The club is highly committed to developing and promoting General Aviation in the area. With a mountain on one end and power lines obstructing the approach on the opposite end, Bang Phra is known as one of the trickiest airfields in Thailand. It requires great dexterity with airplane controls. The scenery accurately depicts the airfield, with custom ground textures, hangars, village landmarks, a custom windsock, custom night lighting, a sloped runway, high power tension lines, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $7.38, requiring at least 7.12 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight recently updated the community regarding their plans for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and eventual upgrades to include the new features made possible with the newly released platform.Â  Their development team has begun evaluating their in-house aircraft in the release build, with promising results in terms of visuals and performance. They plan on bringing their fleet to MSFS 2024 as soon as possible. Asobo has addressed many of the compatibility issues previously found, and they have successfully completed full flights in their newly released RJ Professional, the most complex aircraft in their fleet. However, some compatibility issues still exist and will be worked on. Considering the sheer size of their MSFS fleet, consisting of nine airplanes, the porting process might take a while to complete. Still, Just Flight will keep everyone updated through regular development updates. They also remind users that until the official compatibility update is released, they will not offer support for adventurous users trying to run their 2020 builds in 2024.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airfoillabs has released a couple of development updates for their upcoming 737 MAX for X-Plane, just weeks after announcing it.Â  â The first part of the update covered the progress of 3D development. The modelling team has fully finished the texturing of the upper overhead panel, with a focus on precise geometric accuracy and mechanical detail. The developers have also implemented a custom shader, which they claim has improved visual fidelity. Meanwhile, the flight systems have also received progress, as the engine performance and aerodynamic model have been polished to match real-life behaviour (a video of the flight model in action can be found here). An interesting part of the update is the progress made on the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). Thanks to the new Web API available for X-Plane, the developers will be able to provide a highly functional EFB.Â  The last part dealt with display rendering. The previously mentioned custom shaders also enhanced the instrument displays. The displays that received development were the Primary Flight Display (PFD), Navigational Display (ND) and Engine Indication System. The video of the current state of displays can be seen here. As always, Threshold will keep you updated with all development updates and progress of AFLÂ 737 MAX! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a lengthy two-part development update regarding their plans for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the upcoming Boeing 777F, and their ongoing work on the 747 Classic (with pictures). The first part is very similar to their previous statement on their plans for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with their plan to rebuild their product line in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs SDK and feature all the new niceties still in place:Â  â â Their position regarding pure compatibility without the 2024 niceties is still the same. The compatibility claim made by Asobo didnât prove to be true, with the airplanes not functioning as they should in the new simulator. They have been working together with Asobo to figure out a potential fix that would allow the straightforward drag-and-drop compatibility to work. â The second part concerns their upcoming products (777F, 747 Classic) and further information on their issues with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs SDK. It lists some of the âblockersâ that have been making their lives slightly harder and draws a parallel with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020âs initial period and its initial lack of development tooling.Â  â The 777F remains under beta testing in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, with the latest beta build featuring small fixes, a completed simulation of the cargo deck lighting systems, operational controls of the cargo deck door, safety nets, and âother fun features within the main deck cargo area,â in Randazzoâs words. They have also included further integration with FSDTâs GSX, allowing the software to seamlessly manage their doors, entries, cargo loading, and unloading.Â  â Their best-case scenario plan was to release it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 only if the release went well enough, which did not happen. Thus, they are moving ahead with the release for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.Â  â They anticipate another beta cycle, âlikely earlier next week or the early following week,â and then âshe will roll out of the hangar to support your cargo hauling adventures.â PMDG will let people know when they have the release date set. â The work on the upcoming 747 Classic continues to roll forward, with code-side preparation for the 747-400 reaching an advanced stage of readiness. As the code is running within MSFS 2020 for now, they are beginning mapping changes that will be required to make it MSFS 2024 compatible, making for a âtruly magnificent simulation of this airliner.â â â On the other hand, the 747-100 Classic Whale is shaping up nicely, with feature sets mapped up that will âopen this product line up to a greater swath of users.â âAfter all, while navigating via fixes defined by their lat/lon positions was revolutionary back in 1971, it can be intimidating and confusing for folks who donât understand how the process works or who might not be inclined to take the time to learn it just for their weekend simming experienceâ, justified Randazzo. Their 747 Classic will come with the CIVA triple INS systemâfully modeled to a high degree of detailâwith a built-in flight engineer ready to assist the user should they struggle with its sheer complexity. Hardcore pilots will have the option to handle it all by themselves if they so desire. In addition to the CIVA INS, they will also offer a relatively more modern option: a Honeywell FMS, which equipped many 747-100s later in their service cycle. â They anticipate it will be the âmost detailed classic airliner yet produced for desktop flight simulation.â â PMDGâs lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Developers at Fenix Simulations have recently updated their Airbus A320 series, originally developed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, to bring compatibility with the newly released Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, among other updates. In a blog post on their website, Fenix founder and director Aamir Thacker announces the update, as well as their plans for MSFS 2024. Thacker says that this new update is ânot simply the 2020 version portedâ, and that they ârebuilt the package with the 2024 SDKâ¦[and] have taken advantage of several of the new features present in 2024â. This includes adding experimental support for 4x SimRate, changes to support MSFS 2024 walkaround mode, and more. The update also brings improvements to the aircraft itself, with a rebuilt airmass temperature simulation, rewritten fuel flow and estimated fuel onboard (EFOB) math, and various improvements to the flight model. Thacker provides a disclaimer that the support for MSFS 2024 is âentirely experimental at this stage and DO NOT consider 2024 compatibility an âadvertisedâ featureâ due to MSFS 2024 being unstable, and they âdo not want to begin taking customersâ money on this basis while being unable to guarantee a smooth experienceâ. He continues to say that Fenix âwill not be considering refund requests on the basis of MSFS 2024 experiences/issuesâ, and they âwill not be accepting customer support tickets in the 2024 environment at this timeâ. Additionally, Thacker mentions that they know of certain issues with the aircraft in MSFS 2024, but most of them are related to simulator-level issues which are not necessarily specific to the A320 series. Finally, Thacker adds that Fenix is not yet done with MSFS 2024, stating that âOnce weâve all had more time with the new platform and a few of the bigger issues are resolved, weâll be back to really sink our teeth into new itemsâ. The full changelog can be found in their blog post. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TDS Sim Software recently announced to its Discord community the current state of their product's compatibility (TDS GTNXi) - or lack thereof - with the newly released simulator. According to TDS, their original plan was to provide compatibility within hours of the simulator's official release, with everything prepared on their side to warrant the smoothest process possible, a critical bug with the loading of external WASM gauges rendered that compatibility impossible for the time being. They reinforce that it's not a TDS-exclusive bug but an issue that affects all packages containing WASM gauges. Asobo has been informed, and the company confirms that the issue exists and that they are working on mitigating it.  TDS eagerly awaits the bug's resolution so it can release their product for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The TDS GTNXi Pro is available on their website for roughly $68.21 â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

Just Flight has recently published a development update on their progress with their upcoming Airbus A300B4 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, showcasing the airplaneâs upper flight engineerâs station and its many switches and lights.Â  They claim every single object has been recreated from high-resolution imagery of a real A300B4 based at the Aeroscopia museum in Toulouse, France; meaning all fonts and scales of the gauge backgrounds and annunciator lights are âas accurate as you can get in any simulator.â The showcase begins with the left-hand column, showing where pilots manage passenger and crew oxygen, hydraulics, and fuel.Â  Then, they skip over to the systems related to the landing gear, brakes, and fire detection, with the APU control panel lying at the very bottom and its three vertically stacked gauges for parameter monitoring, a bank of fault annunciators, switches for fuel pumps and starting, and itâs dedicated fire shut-off handle.Â  The upper right section houses the magnetic annunciators, which display a trefoil pattern when a piece of equipment or its circuitry shows some fault. Underneath lies the air conditioning and pressurization system, arranged from the bottom up and following on from the air bleed section. Its sheer size is explained by the dual pressurization systems for redundancy and the separate temperature controls and displays for the six passenger and cargo compartments. The last column features the panels for the flight data recorder, probe heat, and a large metal guard covering the fuel jettison switches, efficiently protecting it from accidental operation. Just Flight also mentioned on their Facebook page that the A300B4 is a MSFS 2020 product for now, and MSFS 2024 compatibility hasnât been looked at yet. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Aerosoft has recently launched its version of Milan Malpensa Airport (LIMC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. As the second busiest airport in Italy and the largest in northern Italy, it serves the city of Milan. The airport welcomes approximately 26.1 million passengers each year. Aviation activities have been taking place in the area of the current airport since 1910. In the early years, the airfield served both general and military aviation. It was not until 1948 that Milan Malpensa Airport began commercial operations. Over the years, the airport has undergone various expansions and continues to develop. In 1998, the Italian airline Alitalia relocated its main hub from the country's largest airport, Rome Fiumicino, to Milan Malpensa. Today, the airport welcomes over 26 million passengers annually, handling approximately 187.000 aircraft movements. It serves as a base for airlines such as easyJet, Neos, and Ryanair, while also accommodating a variety of other airlines that offer destinations around the world, including Rome, Amsterdam, and Singapore. David Rosenfeld has developed the newly released version of Milan Malpensa Airport, featuring an accurate and up-to-date representation of the airport, detailed terminal buildings, high-quality custom objects, realistic night lighting, and more. The add-on requires 3.4 GB of storage space and is available on Aerosoft for approximately $24.21. It's worth noticing that MSFS 2024 compatibility will be available for free in the coming weeks. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Zero Dollar Payware has recently provided an update on their Discord regarding their current products and future plans. The team announced that they have entered the sustaining phase of their lifecycle, which means they will continue to support their existing projects. However, their capacity to start new projects is limited. The focus will be on v2 updates for their current projects. If they do take on any new projects, these will likely be smaller airports, similar in size to Gold Coast Airport. Next year will be dedicated to these v2 updates, although it is possible for a new project to emerge, none are currently planned. The team has provided updates on their current projects. EGLL is making steady progress, with a significant update expected in the first half of 2025, likely to include T5A.Â  â The ZDP Library v1.2 update is nearly complete and is scheduled for release before the end of the year. â RKSI will receive a v2 update featuring an updated taxiway layout, a new runway, new aprons, new buildings, and new ground textures.Â  â MDPC is also set for a v2 update, which will include new ground textures, new vegetation, updated ortho, an updated taxiway layout, an updated apron layout, and completely redone buildings. â The team intends to provide RJAA with a v2 update featuring new ground textures, ortho, vegetation, and more. However, this is a substantial task, and no timeline has been established for its completion. â As for KSDF, PANC, EGNR, KCLL, and YBCG, no updates are currently planned.Â  â Lastly, the EDHI project is unfortunately no longer active due to a lack of cooperation from iniBuilds concerning the Beluga Halle. Additionally, the source files were lost due to a hard drive failure. Consequently, the team has determined that reviving this project is not feasible at this time. The team has stated that they are monitoring the development of X-Plane 12 and the release of next-generation scenery. If any compatibility issues arise from these developments or releases, they will pause their current projects to focus on updates. As a result, the team's plans may be affected and are subject to change. â We will keep you informed as soon as the team shares more information or releases any updates. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
