    <title>Parallel 42 Releases 777 Immersion Pack for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel 42 recently released their 777 Immersion package for Microsoft Flight Simulatorâpart of their SimFX add-onâaiming to improve the overall realism of the effects for the PMDG 777 (and CaptainSim, eventually) with condensation, realistic chemtrails, brake smoke, and more. Available as a single package for all major renditions of the triple seven airframe regardless of the livery used, bringing immersive effects for the PMDG and CaptainSim (at a later date) and customized for each with performance as their top priority.Â  Built on the SimFx framework, it offers the best combination of effects and customizability via the SimFx interface. For the unaware, Parallel 42âs SimFX is a visual effects utility covering a range of immersive scenarios. Environmental variables and formulas authentically govern every particle on the screen, and dynamic effects appear under the right conditions, creating unique moments in the virtual skies. The effects include contrails, heat blurs, wing wash, rotor wash, and more. Their immersion package for the 777 builds on top of what SimFx already offers, bringing nineteen custom effects for the mighty triple seven, including swirling contrails, condensation effects, waste water drain every hour, engine cold start effects, fuel jettison, cloud illumination, hot brakes smoke, carbon brake dust, and water droplets. The APU heat blur and the St. Elmoâs fire are not supported because of a development choice by PMDG, using a deprecated technique preventing SimFX or 777 Immersion from injecting their version of those effects. The package is available on Contrail for roughly $15.00, requiring at least 2 MB of free hard disk space to install. Bear in mind that the 777 Package requires SimFX to work.

PMDG anticipates it to be a rather quick process, and they are already evaluating the next variant after that. A major update has also been pushed to the 737 lineup, bringing the stability and performance fixes they used on the 777. It has also been pushed to the marketplace and might take around two weeks to show up. â More 737 updates are expected as they continue squashing the issues with the 777, and some of the structural changes from the Triple Seven will be back-ported, including the new navdata format, updated lateral path solving, updated autopilot roll modes, updated EFB, and more. â Last but not least, the DC-6 has been updated with the new cockpit textures. It has also been rolled out to the marketplace and might take around two weeks to become available. â PMDG concluded the weekly update thread with a brief note on the 747âs progress. It has been in development since January and is progressing nicely, with âunexpected and very exciting things planned for this product line.âÂ  â PMDGâs product line is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $77.73.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Dubrovnik RuÄer BoÅ¡koviÄ Airport (LDDU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Dubrovnik-Neretva County with a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers. The airport opened in 1962 and quickly became Yugoslaviaâs busiest. By 1987, it had already served nearly a million passengers.Â  In the 2000s, a new passenger terminal was built to replace the original from 1962, costing the administration 70 million euros. Itâs the most modern terminal in the country so far.Â  Itâs a hub for Croatia Airlines and many other European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizz Air, serve it on a seasonal basis. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, an up-to-date layout, and a custom GSX profile.Â  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.36, requiring at least 3.94 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>iniBuilds Teases Airbus A350 for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently uploaded a teaser video and an in-depth development update of their upcoming Airbus A350 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, one of the most awaited addons for the platform so far. The short teaser video reveals some of the 3D art-focused details, along with a glimpse of the systems and sounds. Like their A300-600R, the A350 will feature fully modeled engine interiors, openable cowlings, and more. Users will be able to manage all possible maintenance options via EFB. The wear and tear system, also seen on the A300 to some extent, will be heavily improved. It will feature dynamic weathering of the aircraft, with paint peeling off the rivets, oil, and dirt streaks around potential leakage areas, dirt and grime on flaps, and more. It is said to build up as you fly the aircraft.Â  The cockpit features the same attention to detail, with PBR materials, high-resolution textures, and heavy optimization work to reduce VRAM usage without compromising visual quality.Â  Concerning the realism of the aircraft due to the apparent lack of data available, iniBuilds has said thatâcontrary to popular beliefâthereâs âquite a bitâ of data around for core systems and overall functionality. To fill all the gaps, the missing spots were covered by renting a full-motion A350 simulator for multiple hours. They have also gathered twelve dedicated A350 experts to serve as a complimentary source of information. iniBuilds claims it will be not only visually stunning but will also far exceed anything else they have produced.Â  They have also made a FAQ section with many frequently asked questions regarding their upcoming aircraft and its features.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published a new development update on their upcoming A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, covering their latest visual work on the cockpit. â Their lead artist has been working hard for the past four months on recreating the remaining sections of the A300B4âs cockpit, taking into account every individual gauge, screw, knob, and panel, all with custom weathering and discoloration as per their reference aircraft. With the work now complete, Just Flight will be teasing new bits of the cockpit through the remaining development updates, starting with the center pedestal. â They have authentically recreated the Carousel IV Inertial Navigation System (INS) Control Display Unit (CDU) on both sides. For those wishing for a more modern offering, the UNS-1 FMS will be an option. â The following bits to be showcased are the stabilizer trim wheels, the speed brake lever, a flap/slat lever, the throttle levers, fuel cut-off switches, the parking brake handle, and some buttons. Lastly, the communications suite has 2 VHF control units, a transponder unit, two audio selector panels, weather radar controls, ADF navigation radios, and lighting controls.Â  The next development update will focus on the forward panel and autopilot.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
