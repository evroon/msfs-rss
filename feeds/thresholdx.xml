    <summary>Sim: FS24. Not long after the release of Sim Update 1, the team at Microsoft has launched the in-sim Marketplace for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This Marketplace has been highly anticipated by the community and is now accessible within the simulator. Many items from the Marketplace in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 have been ported to the new simulator. These items should be available in the library and need to be activated. However, content created by Microsoft and Asobo is automatically activated. The Marketplace offers a variety of options. Ported content from the 2020 version to 2024 is marked with a small logo indicating that it is ported. Content upgraded to the 2024 version may have a new price or be available as a free upgrade, and it is also indicated with a logo showing that it has been upgraded. Users can purchase content using Simverse Coins, which is an in-sim currency that can be bought either in the Marketplace or at select retailers. Currently, the Marketplace does not support rentals or gifting, but these features are expected to be introduced with Sim Update 2 in April. Additionally, there are a few known issues with the Marketplace. For the full release notes and details on these issues, please check the official release announcement. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>Meridian GMT Announces Brand; Product Announcement</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/meri25"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d1913052f024653fd52772_meridian%20banner.jpeg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The world of flight simulation hardware welcomes a significant new player today - Meridian GMT. At the helm is Nicki Repenning, a name long familiar to the simulation community through his former role as founder and public face of Honeycomb Aeronautical. While Repenningâs earlier work helped establish some of the most widely adopted peripherals in the sector, Meridian GMT is attempting a distinct break from the past - a clean-slate approach grounded in new principles, or rather, on their terms. Repenning played a central role in bringing to life the Honeycomb Alpha Flight Controls, Bravo Throttle Quadrant, and Charlie Rudder Pedals - devices that saw widespread acclaim for their feature set and accessibility. However, Honeycombâs legacy is not without complications. Despite its disruptive design, price point, and popularity, the Bravo Throttle faced recurring quality concerns, such as cable issues and mechanical wear, which were highlighted in long-term user experiences. Furthermore, the very protracted delivery timeline for the Charlie Rudder Pedals and the outright conflict between Repenning and his former business partner Mike Steup from Snakebyte Group, a German product development company, over the ownership and direction of Honeycomb, left a permanent mark on the brandâs reputation. That conflict was central to the community's growing distrust towards Repenning and the Honeycomb name. These challenges were not unnoticed. Community discourse and critical media coverage, including our own reporting at Threshold, explored the implications of Honeycombâs faltering transparency and logistical setbacks. Our piece "Into the Hive: Updates on Honeycomb's Journey", we provided a deep dive into the frustrations voiced by customers and the broader lessons for hardware developers in the flight sim industry. It should be noted that while Honeycomb eventually fulfilled the Charlie pre-orders, the extended wait, poor support, and surrounding controversy left the brand tainted in the eyes of many. Today, however, marks a turning point. Meridian GMT positions itself not as a continuation of Honeycomb but as a new venture with its own values, structure, and trajectory. While Repenningâs experience is undeniable, Meridian is shaped by a conscious intent to move beyond prior missteps. A more modular design philosophy, increased repairability, a tighter internal team, and strategic outsourcing of non-core competencies reflect this new direction. The companyâs first product presentation will take place this coming weekend. Repenning will take the stage at FSWeekend and reveal three hardware products that aim to set new standards across their respective categories. Until then, the full product lineup remains under wraps. As stated in Meridian GMTâs official press release today on their website. "Meridian GMT is more than just a brand; it's a commitment to the flight simulation community", said Repenning. âOur core values - innovation, precision, durability, and affordability - are at the heart of everything we do. Our mission is to deliver hardware that not only exceeds the expectations of the community but also makes products for the casual flight simmer, embarking on their first solo flight, and bring immersion and fun to their experience too". The brandâs identity is also symbolically constructed. Meridian says the logo reflects its mission: three diamonds representing Community, Industry Partnerships, and Innovation, set within a golden hexagon signifying Legacy. The inverted Y in the logo nods to aviation roots, with a subtle aircraft silhouette formed by the space between the diamonds. While the past casts a long shadow, Meridian GMT is determined to navigate new horizons - without relying on nostalgia or name recognition to carry its message. Â Instead, they hope to enter the market with clear eyes, tempered expectations, and a commitment to better serve the simulation community. The brandâs story begins hereâand what follows will be watched with interest. </summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/350103"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d1d3360d1288fc525c3463_v103NowAvailSocials.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently rolled out a new update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, aiming to mitigate WASM crash issues and aid overall stability. Update 1.0.3 focuses on making the product more stable and less vulnerable to WASM crashes that have plagued the product since its release, sparking a lot of controversy around many online flight sim communities. They have discovered that the update rates between third-party services and the A350âs systems sometimes donât align, inducing issues, and specific data exchanges may cause unexpected increases in memory usage, leading to potential crashes.Â  To further illustrate what has been going on with their A350, iniBuilds decided to provide an in-depth explanation of how the WASM system works and why it may, at times, stop working: it needs memory to run the avionics, custom systems, and other third-party add-ons, which isnât random access memory, but its very own virtual memory running separately inside the simulator, which is allocated according to the demand, and allocation issues may happen, leading to a WASM crash (that either entirely kills the simulator or freezes the airplaneâs system). They have switched their method of handling that by going from manually managing memory to smart pointers, which helps prevent memory leaks and automatically handles freeing up memory when itâs no longer needed. Furthermore, they have taken steps to avoid using unnecessary copy constructors, which lead to high memory usage and performance issues.Â  iniBuilds has also implemented a delay to third-party data requests. Previously, they requested data at 30 fps, which overwhelmed the WASM environment. Now, it only polls it once every second, reducing the memory and processing overhead. The expected benefits of the above measures are fewer crashes due to bad memory management, more efficient memory use in the WASM environment, and better performance and smoothness.Â  The A350 Airliner is available for purchase at the iniBuilds Store for roughly $76.16, requiring at least 10.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Just Flight Releases F28 Professional V2 for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/f28two"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d324880615470b16ee888a_fuk1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has recently released the Fokker F28 Professional Version 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This version brings many significant upgrades over the first version, such as a new flight management system (UNS-1), new cockpit equipment, boarding/refueling simulation, and more. The Fokker F28 Fellowship is a twin-engined regional jet developed in the late 60s. Its first flight was in 1967 and its introduction happened in 1969, with 241 units built after a 20-year run (production ended in 1987). Multiple variants were developed, with the F28-1000 seating up to 70 passengers, the F28-2000 housing 79 people, and the later revision, the F28-4000, featuring quieter engines (Rolls-Royce Spey 555-15H), a redesigned cockpit and modified wings, and increased seating (up to 85 passengers). It was then superseded by the Fokker 70 and 100.Â  As of 2019, there are no current operators of the F28 around, with Fly-SAX being the last to operate it commercially. Garuda Indonesia was the largest former operator, with 62 of them. Other Major operators include the Ansett Group (13), AirQuarius Aviation (4), and Biman Bangladesh Airlines (4). The Ansett Group was also responsible for the longest nonstop F28 route in the world, between Perth and Kununurra, roughly 2300 km apart.Â  Version two of the F28 ensures compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It adds many new features to the product, further enriching its realism, such as the new UNS-1 flight management system, new cockpit equipment, boarding and refueling simulation, and more. Please refer to this page for further information on all the features included.Â  Itâs available in their store for $50.39 (a promotional price to celebrate the new update). V1 owners are entitled to a free upgrade. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. It was quite the day in Lelystad, Netherlands, today, with FSWeekend kicking off a jam-packed weekend of announcements, presentations, and more flight sim news. Saturday saw five hours of presentations, and weâre here to round todayâs big announcements up for you right in one place! Threshold is also on the ground, covering the event in person, so if you see any of us around, feel free to say hi and chat! â First up was Sayintentions.ai, CEO Brian Shellabarger making three big announcements regarding their AI ATC add-on: AI Living World, OpenSky Beta, and SkyNet. AI Living World is Sayintentionsâ new traffic injection and sequencing feature, connecting AI traffic to their existing AI ATC. According to Shellabarger, each injected aircraft is an individual AI entity, following real-world schedules, with the AI ATC sequencing every aircraft according to actual weather conditions. AI Living World is set to launch for partner customers on April 15 for MSFS 2020 and 24, with X-Plane support coming later this year. SkyNet, Sayintentionsâ basic AI ATC service currently in closed beta, is now free. It will boast features such as premium neural voices, authentic phraseology, radio chatter, and more, all fully cloud-based. However, the service will be ATC only, limited to IFR gate-to-gate operations with little flexibility. Wrapping up their presentation was the announcement of the release of SkyNet, which is now available to all Sayintentions.ai customers for MSFS 2020 and 24. SkyNet is a real-time multiplayer network featuring model matching, cross-platform support, and the ability to create/join private groups. It will be available for the whole community early this summer, with AI sequencing and X-Plane support planned for the future. Navigraph was next, having announced a new feature for their popular Charts software called Scratchpads. Scratchpads will give users templates to write notes, such as ATIS, CRAFT clearances, and takeoff performance. No exact release date has been provided, but Navigraph CEO Magnus Axholt says it will come âvery soonâ. Swiss developers FlightSim Studio have announced the 727 Passenger for MSFS 2020, coming next month in April 2025. It features a fully modelled cabin and more. Along with that, they announced the Super 27 Expansion, which includes more powerful JT8D-217 or JT8D-219 engines and a modern avionics package with a new autopilot, FMS, EFIS, GPS, and more. According to FSS, the Super 27 Expansion will come later this year. FSS also announced progress for their E-Jets series for MSFS, which will soon include a new MCDU with support for custom nav data importing, performance improvements, new MFD modes, weather radar, enhanced LNAV, and more. However, FSS did not mention a release date for this update. Finally, there was WinWing, who announced a slew of new hardware products. On the roadmap for 2025 are additions to the Ursa Minor lineup, the MIP series, and the new Cyber Taurus joystick bases. The very popular Ursa Minor lineup will be getting an Airbus A320-style throttle quadrant and pedestal controls, priced at $127.95 and $107.95 respectively, will boast metal construction and detents, authentic backlighting, and the ability to switch between detent and detentless modes with one button. Following their highly successful MIP panel releases, WinWing announced the MIP Airline PAP 3 Panel, this time styled after the Boeing 737 MCP, which will feature full backlighting, realistic knobs, and more, for $149.95. The PAP 3 Panel can be upgraded with the MIP MAG Switch, a magnetic switch for the autothrottle function, which will be available for purchase either separately for $49.95 or pre-installed to the PAP 3 panel for $199.99. Along with the PAP 3 Panel will be the MIP Airline PDC 3N Panel, modelled after the 737 EFIS Panel, and will be available for $84.95. Concluding the MIP series additions is the MIP Combat 13 CNI-MU Panel, styled like the 737 FMC, but with combat-focused functions, priced at $129.95. Lastly, WinWing announced additions to the Cyber Taurus series, with three new joystick bases and a rudder pedal set, all being force-feedback driven. The base tier Cyber Taurus joystick base will include electronic load control, belt-driven construction, and a rated output of more than 20 NM, priced at $414.95. The higher tier, the Cyber Taurus (D) joystick base, will have two versions: a gear-reduced model and a direct drive model. The gear-reduced model will have a rated output of more than 60 NM, and the direct drive model will have a rated output of more than 16 NM. Both will be available for $699.95. Closing out their presentation, they showcased the Cyber Taurus Electronic Load Control Rudder Pedals, which will have a rated output of more than 170 NM, and a pricetag of $799.95. â That closes a very packed day at Europeâs largest flight simulation convention!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Starting off the announcements today at FSWeekend, Honeycomb Aeronautical announced four new products. These new products come in two different ranges, the Flagship range, and the all new Lite range.Â  Firstly, they announced the Sierra TPM module. Following on the success of the Bravo Throttle Quadrant, the Sierra TPM module focuses on general aviation, with Cessna-style knobs instead of levers. Along with the knobs, it will come with an integrated trim wheel, parking brake, flap, and gear controls. Once available, the Sierra TPM will be priced at $249.99. Next, Honeycomb announced their entry into the joystick market with the Foxtrot Aviation Stick. Honeycomb previously had announced a similar stick in 2020, but that was back before their management debacle. This new Foxtrot stick will include a linear resistance system with adjustable tension, five two-way switches, four programmable action buttons, along with three rotary switches. However, unlike its previous iteration, the new Foxtrot Aviation Stick will not include an integrated gear lever or throttle lever. No pricing information has been released yet for the Foxtrot. Honeycomb then introduced their new Lite product lineup, featuring two new products, the Alpha Lite, and Bravo Lite. The Alpha Lite, like its more premium counterpart, features the same popular yoke design, but does not include the switch panel. When it becomes available for purchase, the Alpha Lite will be priced at $199.99. Finally, the Bravo Lite will feature four axes, an integrated trim wheel, interchangeable flap detents, and a parking brake control. It will be priced exactly the same as the Alpha Lite at $199.99 when available. Honeycomb says that all of these products will be available for purchase by Christmas this year. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Meridian GMT announced its initial product line during today's final presentation at FSWeekend. Founded by Honeycomb Aeronautical founder and former CEO Nicki Repenning, Meridian GMT hopes to break into an increasingly competitive hardware market. â Their initial lineup consists of three new products: The Sierra Plus Flight Controls, the Tango Plus Throttle Quadrant, and the X-Ray Flight Controller. Meridianâs focus for these products is a multi-purpose and modular approach. â Repenning started the presentation by showcasing the Sierra Plus (not to be confused with the Honeycomb Sierra TPM), which he says includes many improvements over his previous designs, chiefly the Honeycomb Alpha. The Sierra Plus will boast features such as swappable button and switch panels, quick-release yoke, vibration motors, and under-table mounting. Multiple panel configurations will be available for the Sierra Plus, including a commercial configuration based on the Boeing 737 and a general aviation configuration complete with a chronometer. On release, the Sierra Plus will be priced at approximately $325 (â¬299.99). Next, Repenning moved to what he says is âthe product that I am most excited aboutâ, the Tango Plus Throttle Quadrant. Like the Sierra Plus, the Tango Plus builds on previous designs' success, adding modularity, among other features. Meridian has packed the Tango Plus with features, including an annunciator panel, trim wheel, exterior light switches, auto brake knob, and more. The flagship feature of the Tango Plus is the swappable avionics and throttle configurations. Users can customize their quadrant based on the type of aircraft they are flying, with Repenning mentioning configurations for single and multi-engine general aviation, as well as configs for Airbus and Boeing, which will include detents. The avionics receive the same treatment, the general aviation config receiving a Garmin-style radio and autopilot panel, the Boeing panel styled after the 737 MCP, and the Airbus panel made to represent the FCU. Meridianâs final product is the X-Ray Flight Controller, which Repenning says is âthe product that will launch first into the marketâ. The X-Ray Flight Controller is Meridianâs answer to the increasingly popular console market, being an Xbox controller with various features specific to flight simulation. No pricing information has been announced for the Tango Plus or the X-Ray controller, but Threshold will keep you informed, so stay tuned! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/350104"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d74ca627ae5eebe484b673_104.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued an update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing system depth improvements, art tweaks, and more. Update v1.0.4 aims to increase the systems simulation further, bringing extra depth and more overall fidelity. Following customer feedback and further investigation, the art was also tweaked on the long-winglet model for the A350-900, improving its shape and profile.Â  ini has also done extra optimization work for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version by tweaking node counts and refining the system for swapping cockpits. These changes significantly reduce CPU load and bring smoother performance and fewer stutters, especially on lower-end systems. As the update changes the 3D model to some extent, all liveries will need to be redownloaded or updated to work with the new version in both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. They claim this was necessary to ensure the key fixes in the patch could be carried out at once. More WASM fixes were also introduced to enhance the productâs stability further, resolving multiple crashes related to TCAS activation, flight plan imports, and Navigraph integration.Â  The developers claim to remain dedicated to continuous improvement and deeper simulation accuracy, with ongoing refinements across all areas of the A350âs systems.Â  The complete changelog for the update follows below: v1.0.4Systems &amp; EFB âï¸ð¥ï¸Fixed -

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Announces Western Sydney International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d75244a47f8ad7c024a98c_syd1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design recently announced the development of Western Sydney International Airport (YSWS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport is set to begin operating in late 2026 and supplement Sydneyâs Kingsford Smith International, which has been operating at capacity due to a legislated curfew. After a more than decade-long debate on the location, the government officially designated the site in April 2014. It was conceived to operate 24 hours a day, with no curfews whatsoever, helping mitigate the fact Sydneyâs main airport is already operating at capacity and with limited slots. The administration has decided to build the airport in multiple phases, starting with a smaller terminal and a single runway and eventually building up as required. Phase one â which is nearing completion â consists of that one âsmallâ terminal, able to handle up to 10 million passengers a year, and a single 3700m runway. As of June 2024, the terminal was 80% ready and set to reach total completion by January 2026. Itâs going to be Australiaâs first fully digital air traffic control system, using a 45-meter-tall mast with over twenty high-definition cameras instead of a traditional control tower. The developer plans to fully utilize Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs capabilities, aiming to deliver highly detailed visuals, optimized performance, and an immersive flight simulation experience. For that, they seek reference materials, including airport documentation, high-quality images, charts, blueprints, and operational insights. If you fit the criteria, feel free to contact the developer here.Â  Thereâs no information on pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Papa Delta Studio recently released their rendition of Szczecin-GoleniÃ³w Airport (EPSC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Szczecin, Poland, and has a yearly average of 600,000 passengers. It was built as a standard military airport between 1953 and 1956 during the Cold War, with a 1,800-meter runway and basic infrastructure. It wasnât until eleven years later that it became a civilian airport. In the late 1970s, the runway was extended to 2,500 meters, and a new passenger terminal was built. Extra effort was made in the late 1990s to improve the runway and the main apron, followed by the opening of a new passenger terminal in 2001.Â  Four years after its inauguration, the new terminal underwent expansion to accommodate the predicted passenger figures for the decade. Completion was achieved a year later, in 2006. LOT Polish Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Smartwings Poland, and Wizz Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a high-quality terminal model, custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, custom static aircraft, custom 3D people models, custom ground service equipment, custom clutter, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $7.31, requiring at least 87.55 MB of free hard disk space to install.
