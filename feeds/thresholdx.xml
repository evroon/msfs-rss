    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently issued a major update to their rendition of Dunedin Airport (NZDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including improvements, bug fixes, further optimization, and more. Built in 1962 to replace a nearby airfield (Taieri Airfield) deemed not economically feasible to expand for the expected air travel demand, Dunedin was idealized for short-haul aircraft services. NZNAC was one of the first airlines to serve the airport with its fleet of Fokker Friendships and Vickers Viscounts.  The airport first underwent upgrades in the late 1960s and 1970s, with the inclusion of automatic sliding doors in 1969 and a toilet expansion in 1971. Three years later, it also got a new mezzanine floor and an aircraft viewing deck.  It was upgraded again in 1988 when the administration built airline lounges and airbridges to accommodate Ansett New Zealand's Boeing 737 operations (later replaced by BAe 146s). A runway extension followed soon after in 1993, bringing it to its current length of 1,900 meters. A new terminal building was inaugurated in October 2005, considerably increasing its passenger handling capabilities. It's served by Air New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington) and Jetstar (Auckland), averaging around 1 million passengers per year. Update 1.1 brings a vast list of changes to their rendition, including new hangars (entirely redone), a new ATC tower, LODs on terminal and hangars for extra performance, night lighting improvements, improved jetway docking, texture optimizations, and more. The complete changelog follows below: â âIt's available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $7.67, requiring at least 4.05 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A new local legend has been released by the Microsoft Flight Simulator team. It's the Dornier Do 31, an interesting-looking VTOL experimental military aircraft made by West Germany in the late 1960s. The development of this distinctive aircraft was driven by German interest in Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing Aircraft (STOVL) aircraft. In addition to test flights, the aircraft was present at the Paris Air Show in 1969. A total of five world records were broken during its short service from 1967 to 1970). Most of those records were broken during the ferry flight to Paris. The plane was one of a kind since no one had ever tried to produce or design a similar aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the high operating costs, the Do 31 project was canceled in April 1970. Although the plane did not live for long, it was still an engineering masterpiece featuring a hybrid digital-analog supercomputer, the Do-960. The supercomputer collected all inputs from the pilot and converted them into thrust controls. Even after the project was abandoned, the computer was implemented all around the world, due to its amazing performance. With a service ceiling of 35.100 feet, a maximum speed of 393kt (730km/h, 452mph), and a range of 1800 km (1200 mi) the newly released plane comes with seven liveries: 1 Experimental, E3 Experimental, Olive Green, Green Camouflage, Marine Search &amp; Rescue, Xbox Aviators Club, and Aviators Club. The newly released plane is now available on the in-Sim Marketplace for $14.99 and takes up 7.66GB of disk space when installed. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6618c9dead3989329b5a7ebe_gdru1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations and db Scenery have recently released their rendition of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.  â Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. â It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, custom landside, custom terrain mesh, custom ambient sounds, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's available in the MSFSÂ Marketplace for $9. Refer to the product page for further information.  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>
