    <summary>Sim: FS24. TDS Sim Software recently announced to its Discord community the current state of their product's compatibility (TDS GTNXi) - or lack thereof - with the newly released simulator. According to TDS, their original plan was to provide compatibility within hours of the simulator's official release, with everything prepared on their side to warrant the smoothest process possible, a critical bug with the loading of external WASM gauges rendered that compatibility impossible for the time being. They reinforce that it's not a TDS-exclusive bug but an issue that affects all packages containing WASM gauges. Asobo has been informed, and the company confirms that the issue exists and that they are working on mitigating it.  TDS eagerly awaits the bug's resolution so it can release their product for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The TDS GTNXi Pro is available on their website for roughly $68.21 â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Just Flight has recently published a development update on their progress with their upcoming Airbus A300B4 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, showcasing the airplaneâs upper flight engineerâs station and its many switches and lights.Â  They claim every single object has been recreated from high-resolution imagery of a real A300B4 based at the Aeroscopia museum in Toulouse, France; meaning all fonts and scales of the gauge backgrounds and annunciator lights are âas accurate as you can get in any simulator.â The showcase begins with the left-hand column, showing where pilots manage passenger and crew oxygen, hydraulics, and fuel.Â  Then, they skip over to the systems related to the landing gear, brakes, and fire detection, with the APU control panel lying at the very bottom and its three vertically stacked gauges for parameter monitoring, a bank of fault annunciators, switches for fuel pumps and starting, and itâs dedicated fire shut-off handle.Â  The upper right section houses the magnetic annunciators, which display a trefoil pattern when a piece of equipment or its circuitry shows some fault. Underneath lies the air conditioning and pressurization system, arranged from the bottom up and following on from the air bleed section. Its sheer size is explained by the dual pressurization systems for redundancy and the separate temperature controls and displays for the six passenger and cargo compartments. The last column features the panels for the flight data recorder, probe heat, and a large metal guard covering the fuel jettison switches, efficiently protecting it from accidental operation. Just Flight also mentioned on their Facebook page that the A300B4 is a MSFS 2020 product for now, and MSFS 2024 compatibility hasnât been looked at yet. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Aerosoft has recently launched its version of Milan Malpensa Airport (LIMC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. As the second busiest airport in Italy and the largest in northern Italy, it serves the city of Milan. The airport welcomes approximately 26.1 million passengers each year. Aviation activities have been taking place in the area of the current airport since 1910. In the early years, the airfield served both general and military aviation. It was not until 1948 that Milan Malpensa Airport began commercial operations. Over the years, the airport has undergone various expansions and continues to develop. In 1998, the Italian airline Alitalia relocated its main hub from the country's largest airport, Rome Fiumicino, to Milan Malpensa. Today, the airport welcomes over 26 million passengers annually, handling approximately 187.000 aircraft movements. It serves as a base for airlines such as easyJet, Neos, and Ryanair, while also accommodating a variety of other airlines that offer destinations around the world, including Rome, Amsterdam, and Singapore. David Rosenfeld has developed the newly released version of Milan Malpensa Airport, featuring an accurate and up-to-date representation of the airport, detailed terminal buildings, high-quality custom objects, realistic night lighting, and more. The add-on requires 3.4 GB of storage space and is available on Aerosoft for approximately $24.21. It's worth noticing that MSFS 2024 compatibility will be available for free in the coming weeks. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Zero Dollar Payware has recently provided an update on their Discord regarding their current products and future plans. The team announced that they have entered the sustaining phase of their lifecycle, which means they will continue to support their existing projects. However, their capacity to start new projects is limited. The focus will be on v2 updates for their current projects. If they do take on any new projects, these will likely be smaller airports, similar in size to Gold Coast Airport. Next year will be dedicated to these v2 updates, although it is possible for a new project to emerge, none are currently planned. The team has provided updates on their current projects. EGLL is making steady progress, with a significant update expected in the first half of 2025, likely to include T5A.Â  â The ZDP Library v1.2 update is nearly complete and is scheduled for release before the end of the year. â RKSI will receive a v2 update featuring an updated taxiway layout, a new runway, new aprons, new buildings, and new ground textures.Â  â MDPC is also set for a v2 update, which will include new ground textures, new vegetation, updated ortho, an updated taxiway layout, an updated apron layout, and completely redone buildings. â The team intends to provide RJAA with a v2 update featuring new ground textures, ortho, vegetation, and more. However, this is a substantial task, and no timeline has been established for its completion. â As for KSDF, PANC, EGNR, KCLL, and YBCG, no updates are currently planned.Â  â Lastly, the EDHI project is unfortunately no longer active due to a lack of cooperation from iniBuilds concerning the Beluga Halle. Additionally, the source files were lost due to a hard drive failure. Consequently, the team has determined that reviving this project is not feasible at this time. The team has stated that they are monitoring the development of X-Plane 12 and the release of next-generation scenery. If any compatibility issues arise from these developments or releases, they will pause their current projects to focus on updates. As a result, the team's plans may be affected and are subject to change. â We will keep you informed as soon as the team shares more information or releases any updates. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently announced the development and imminent release of Brisbane Airport (YBBN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Brisbane Airport is the largest airport in Australia by land area and the third busiest in passenger traffic, with a yearly average of 23.2 million passengers. The airportâs construction started in 1980. Built by Leighton Contractors, it cost 400 million dollars and opened eight years later. It initially had a domestic terminal and two runways. Nearly a decade later, in September 1995, the international terminal was inaugurated, bringing in further passenger traffic. In 2007, the government approved the construction of a new parallel runway, which was expected to take eight years to build on swamp land 2 kilometers west of the terminal area. The unexpectedly long construction time was due to the settling period of the 13,000,000 cubic meters of sand gathered from Moreton Bay to cover the swamp. Work was completed in 2020, costing $1 billion and taking precisely eight years from start to finish. Itâs a hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia. Air Canada, Air Niugini, Alliance Airlines, American Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, EVA Air, Fiji Airways, FlyPelican, Jetstar, Korean Air, Link Airways, National Jet Express, Nauru Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, QantasLink, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Skytrans Airlines, Solomon Airlines, United Airlines, VietJet Air, and Virgin Australia also serve it. â Thereâs no information regarding pricing or features yet, but Threshold will keep you informed.Â  â</summary>

    <title>PMDGâs Boeing 777F Release Date Confirmed, 737 Lineup Update, and More</title>
    <updated>2024-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777612"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6748f61a71e1eca5334fa74f_777f1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG has published yet another development update, bringing further information on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 add-on compatibility, the release date of their upcoming 777F, and a micro-update for their 737 Lineup, bringing it to full parity with the marketplace version. The 737NG lineup has been updated to version 3.00.0108, matching the marketplace version to be made available in early December (according to Randazzo's predictions). It's mostly a micro-update, removing "some cruft that was determined to be unneeded in the release build of the product" at the request of the Marketplace's intake team. In their previous development update, they mentioned that the 777F would get a release date once they had issued a few cleanup builds to their beta testers. This has happened, and now they have a date in mind: next Friday (06/12), during the evening, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Pricing will be announced at release. The add-on will feature accurately modeled supernumary controls and functions, main deck lighting systems, manual or automatic operation of the main deck cargo door, safety guards, and more. They have also increased the GSX compatibility by allowing FSDT's plugin to control the doors, loading process, etc. Their take on MSFS 2024, compatibility-wise, is still the same as that of the previous development updates: they have not yet been able to fully gauge the amount of work required because the new simulator does not yet provide the required tooling. Randazzo shared PMDG's thoughts on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: "My answer remains optimistic. I have been exploring the new sim while flying the PMDG DC-6 which is not yet fully compatible, but overlooking the dim displays and some font issues, gives a very good representation of what it will be like once we get the fleet compatible with the new platform". "MSFS24 is to my eye more convincing visually than any simulation platform we have ever seen [...] It offers more opportunity to engage in interesting flying, varied degrees of flying, community participation and engaged learning than any simulation platform we have had access to in the short 40+ years I've called myself a simmer", he concluded. PMDG's aircraft lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Flight Sim Labs recently launched their new website design, featuring a landing page for their upcoming A321ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and a selection of screenshots, details, pricing information, and more. The company rose to fame in 2016 after releasing the first high-fidelity Airbus A320 add-on. This add-on allowed Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3d users to experience the day-to-day operation of one of the most popular airliners, one that had not yet been developed to such standards (which quickly changed within five years). Described as âthe most advanced Airbus A321ceo simulation for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020â, FSLabsâ upcoming bird is said to bring a combination of cutting-edge technology with unrivaled attention to detail, featuring immersive cabin operations, custom MEL (minimum equipment list) systems, next-generation visuals, enhanced systems, dynamic effects, realistic operational hazards, and real-world navigation obstacles such as GPS jamming, based on real-world data.Â  The add-on will retail for $69.99 and feature two engine options (CFM56 and IAE V2500), wingtip fences and/or sharklets, totaling up to four variants included in the package. They have also announced the development of an A321neo next, which is still being worked on but is said to âfollow shortly behindâ the release of the current engine option variant. Owners of the ceo between its release and the Neoâs release will be eligible for a discount. Refer to their website for further information on the upcoming product(s).

Update 2.3.0.541, very much like the previous update, primarily focuses on improving the stability and usability of the add-on in both platforms, addressing issues that would lead to CTDs, improving the robustness of displays, fixing pause at the top of descent, further improving the loading and unloading of the product in MSFS 2024, and wholly mitigating a clickspot issue in the EFB, also a 2024-only issue. The complete changelog follows below: Avionics and Systems EFB Their product lineup is available on their website for roughly $114 (at the time of writing).
