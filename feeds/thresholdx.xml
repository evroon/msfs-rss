    <title>UK2000 Scenery Releases Exeter Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Exeter Airport (EGTE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the counties of Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, and Dorset, with a yearly average of 382,000 passengers. It was officially opened in early 1937 as an airfield, with a tent serving as the terminal, before the construction of permanent structures would eventually follow. Shortly after its debut, the airport was used by the Royal Air Force as RAF Exeter, where the RAF Fighter Command was based and played a crucial role during the Battle of Britain. It was also used by the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force as a troop transport base for D-Day. Immediately after the war, it was briefly occupied by a French air force fighter squadron serving under the RAF, which departed a year later. By 1947, it had been transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation for civilian use, although some RAF activity continued until the early 1950s. Scheduled services started in 1952, flying people to the Channel Islands and multiple charter destinations. A new terminal was built in the 1980s, along with a runway extension to ensure the safe operation of larger airplanes. The runway was recently resurfaced, and LED lighting was installed, resulting in a significant reduction in operating costs and maintenance. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, PBR materials, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.66, requiring at least 63.06 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their fifth pack of Papua New Guinea Highland Bush Strips, featuring seven new airstrips (Dusin, Yomneri, Kanainj, Bank, Kombaku, Ambaluwa, Bundi). Bush airstrips in Papua New Guinea are generally the only gateway to certain remote villages, making them vital to their existence and the primary means of bringing in supplies. The weather is often harsh, the runways are often short and hand-carved, and the challenge is unparalleled. The pack leverages MSFS 2024âs powerful SDK to provide an even more immersive experience.  Each airstrip features their unique terminal buildings, infrastructure, signage, etc., and the developer (Ken Hall) plans to add more stuff in the near future. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.60, requiring at least 2.84 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has recently shared a batch of work-in-progress screenshots of their upcoming Service Pack 1 update for their 737 Max, showcasing the -8200 expansion used by Ryanair, a basic weather radar, a new EFB, and more. They also made sure to highlight that thereâs no ETA for a release yet, and the new update isnât even in the hands of testers yet, still being a developer-only build in its current state. The add-on, albeit without the SP1 update yet, is available on Flight1 Software for $69.95. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released Flow Pro and Flow Essentials for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, their popular customizable menu system first seen in late 2022 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. â Originally built to challenge the status quo and offer a new and improved way of accessing and interacting with information within the simulator, Flow quickly became very popular among Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 pilots, who were eager for it to become available in 2024 as well. â The developers had to rebuild the tool due to how much Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 changed under the hood, which led to a few complications at first.  â Flow 2024 is a PC-only release and wonât be available for consoles. Current Flow Pro and Essentials owners are entitled to a $2 upgrade. â Itâs available on their website for $30 (Pro) and $20 (Essentials). The main difference between Essentials and Pro is that Essentials canât be modified, whereas Pro allows for custom scripting.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iBlueYonder has released 7S3 Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing a rebuilt version of the classic Oregon airfield to MSFS 2024.Â  Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark is a small, privately operated general aviation field, operated by the Stark family since 1972. It sits in the Willamette Valley, about 17 nautical miles south-west of Portland International Airport, surrounded by farmland and orchards, with easy VFR routes to the Cascade Range, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Pacific coast. The new version features an accurate airport layout and buildings as of 2025, highly detailed ground polygons, several open hangars for parking, animated people, and animated birds around the field. True to the real location, the sloping, multi-level runway is modelled, and there are plenty of small touches, such as llamas near the airfield, and bespoke night lighting. Features: Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark for MSFS 2024 is available now via the Contrail app and webshop for $10.68. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. OnAir Airline Manager has launched its Christmas Challenge 2025 event, âOperation Arctic Revitalisationâ. Running from Nov. 26 2025, 0830Z until Dec. 24 2025, 0830Z, the campaign sends pilots on a winter journey across Iceland and the Arctic region, to deliver fragile Healing Vials from ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur Airport (BIIS) to Santaâs âHealing Houseâ, at Ivalo Airport (EFIV). The main mission follows a six-leg route via HÃ³lmavÃ­k, VÃ¡gar, Ãlesund, Mo i Rana, and Kiruna, using event aircraft, provided free of charge on each sector. The vials are carried in a sensitive stabiliser that reacts to harsh manoeuvres, so pilots must fly low, smooth, and precisely. Optional secondary flights deliver Dilithium Units from surrounding airports to keep the stabiliser powered and the mission progressing. Scoring awards 100 points for each completed main leg, plus a bonus based on the remaining condition of the Healing Vial. The top 10 players on the global leaderboard are guaranteed a prize from a pool that includes store vouchers, copies of the PMDG 737 for MSFS 2024, SayIntentions.AI subscriptions, and products from Pilot Experience Sim. Active companies can also earn an in-game credit bonus, based on their event revenue. The Christmas Challenge is open to both existing and new users, with a free seven-day trial of OnAir Airline Manager available for anyone who wants to take part. Full details, tutorials, and background story material are available on the official OnAir website. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Flight Simulation Association has announced several changes for FlightSimExpo 2026, including Friday exhibit hall access for the first time, and new single-day ticket options for attendees who cannot commit to the full three-day show. New for 2026, the exhibit hall at the Saint Paul RiverCentre will open on Friday, 12 June, from 2130Z to 0000Z, directly after #FSExpoFridayâs product reveals and developer updates, which now begin at 1700Z.Â  FSA Co-Founder Evan Reiter said the change is a direct response to attendee feedback, noting that âthis change allows us to offer attendees 20% more time in the exhibit hall without changing the overall travel footprint for our partnersâ. The rest of the weekend schedule remains familiar, with announcements, hands-on exhibits and demonstrations, product updates, developer Q&amp;As, workshops, and more on Saturday and Sunday.Â  Co-Founder Phil Coyle added that the team is planning additional off-site activities, such as tower and airport tours and museum visits, with details to follow in early 2026. Alongside the expanded Friday programme, FlightSimExpo 2026 will introduce new single-day ticket options.  In addition to a full âEntire Eventâ ticket, attendees will be able to purchase Friday-only, Saturday-only, or Sunday-only access, aimed particularly at simmers who cannot attend all three days, especially those local to the MinneapolisâSaint Paul area. Sponsor, exhibitor, and speaker registration is open now. Software developers, hardware vendors, non-profits, and other flight simulation organisations can book all-inclusive booth packages, that include furnishings, internet, electricity, and event passes, with educational speaking slots available at no charge. Attendees who cannot travel to Minnesota will again be able to follow #FSExpoFriday and the weekend seminars online, via the FSA Captain subscription, or a one-time online-only ticket.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. SimAtlas has officially launched as a subscription service for Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering PC users a new way to access payware add-ons.  For a promotional rate of $12 per month initially, and $16 per month thereafter, subscribers gain access to a library of more than 100 payware products, representing over $1,400 in combined retail value. Content is licensed directly from developers and delivered through a dedicated desktop client, which handles installation, updates, and Community folder management automatically.  The software is designed to work alongside AI traffic packages and GSX, and needs to remain open while MSFS is running.  The team says its goal is to make high-quality content easier to discover, and significantly more affordable to enjoy, while still supporting creators financially, and stresses that SimAtlas does not remove or restrict existing one-time purchase options.  A free demo tier with select freeware content is also available, allowing users to test the platform before committing to a paid plan. For developers, SimAtlas offers a recurring revenue model on top of existing sales channels. Content is wrapped in the clientâs DRM system and remains accessible only to active subscribers, with the company stating that a significant majority of subscription income is returned to participating developers as royalties.  Studios may choose to license a single product or an entire catalogue, and the platform supports all add-on types that live in the Community folder. Freeware authors can also distribute their work through the free tier for additional visibility, albeit without monetisation. Further information, including the current content line-up and developer onboarding details, is available on the official website. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the long-awaited Sim Update 4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, introducing substantial performance improvements, numerous bug fixes, and additional enhancements. â With a kilometer-long checklist, Sim Update 4 might just be the most important Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 patch yet, bringing huge improvements to the table, especially on the performance front, where it had been previously lacking, being borderline unplayable on systems with not enough VRAM due to how DirectX 12 handles that by nature, tanking performance and causing stutters. SU4 attempts to lower that footprint slightly, allowing breathing room for it to work without major hiccups here and there. â Furthermore, the update also adds the Boom XB-1 and launches the Red Bull Air Races mode. The complete changelog follows below: â The update is now available on all compatible platforms.

    <title>A2A Simulations Announces Native Accu-Sim Comanche 250 Update for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of a native build of their Accu-Sim Comanche 250 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, including new 2024-only features such as the new EFB apps, dirt accumulation, and more. The upgrade - which will be paid for - will bring native 2024 gauges, a native 2024 EFB with charts and other apps, a full walkaround system using 2024âs standards, dirt accumulation on the exterior, dual PMS/TDS GTN 750/650 configuration, time compression support, and much more. The complete feature list follows below: â - Native 2024 gauges and model with optimized LODs - Native 2024 EFB, allowing the tablet to show charts and other EFB apps - Full walkaround using 2024 system - Dirt accumulation on the exterior, persistent between flights - Dual PMS 750/650 and TDS GTNxi 750/650 GPS configurations for those who want more GPS in the cockpit - Narco NS-800 RNAV configuration for those who want less GPS in the cockpit - STEC ST-901 GPSS module for those who want to follow magenta line on autopilot - Optional Asobo G5 electronic instrument retrofit - Other improvements like time compression support â It will be a $14.99 upgrade for MSFS 2020 owners. â They followed up with a brief Q&amp;A regarding specific aspects of the product, such as livery compatibility and persistence files: Persistence (.dat files): Youâll be able to manually copy your 2020 files into the 2024 version to continue your aircraft history. Instructions will be provided at release; feel free to post on the A2A Forums if you need help. â MSFS2020 liveries: They wonât work as-is, but can be updated to 2024 format (similar to the Aerostar transition). â Aircraft replacement: The Native 2024 Comanche replaces the 2020 version for MSFS2024 users. Your MSFS2020 Comanche will continue working for those who want to keep it. â Performance: Accu-Sim prioritises simulation over visuals. Thereâs only so much detail we can add before impacting performance and we tend to push as much as we can to the core simulation elements over the eye candy. The MSFS2024 Native Comanche uses optimized LODs and as a native model, keeping performance at least on par and often slightly improved over the 2020 version. â Marketplace: Paid optional upgrade. Weâll coordinate with store partners so existing customers receive a discount. Marketplace releases usually take longer; the A2A Store and other vendors go live first. â Thereâs still no information on the release date, but more details will be shared in the coming weeks.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. flyt Simulations has recently released a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024-native version of Comandante Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport (SBJE), offering full compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, and additional features. Funded by a government plan to develop regional aviation in Brazil, construction work began in 2011 and concluded three years later. The inauguration, however, only took place in 2017 after a series of organizational mishaps. The passenger terminal, designed by Francisco Antonio Laprovitera Teixeira, consists of a single block with departure and arrival areas, food kiosks, bathrooms at each extremity, andâunfortunatelyâfew check-in desks. Its 2200m runway is long enough to accommodate an Airbus A320 and its Boeing counterpart, the 737-800. â Itâs served by Azul (Belo Horizonte), Azul Conecta (Fortaleza, ParnaÃ­ba), Gol Transportes AÃ©reos (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos), and LATAM Brasil (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos). The update introduces native MSFS 2024 compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, enhanced LOD optimization, new vegetation models, and terrain CGL changes.  â Itâs available in the Marketplace for $9.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a move that might turn a few heads, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has received a free Stranger Things expansion, created in partnership with Netflix. The package drops the Simmer in Hawkins, Indiana, and asks them to support the town, as it faces lockdowns, patrols, and threats from the Upside Down. At the centre of the expansion is a Bell UH-1H Huey, in Hawkins Heli-Tours colours, flown under the watch of Murray Bauman. Players can complete five story-driven missions that include everything from rescue work to supply runs and chase sequences, before unlocking a tour mode that allows free exploration.Â  The release also adds a detailed recreation of Hawkins, with more than 40 recognisable locations from the series, along with themed avatar outfits and "supernatural encounters. The helicopter itself has been developed by Taogâs Hangar, which is now confirmed as a first-party partner on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.Â Â  The Stranger Things Expansion is available now, through the in-sim Marketplace on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Rowsfire has opened pre-orders for a new range of 1:1-scale Airbus-style panels for home cockpit builders.Â  The line-up includes the A111 RMP-ACP Radio and Audio Panel, the A112 Cockpit Lighting and Weather Radar Integrated Panel, the A113 Cockpit Lighting, DFOR, and ATC Integrated Panel, and the A109 ATT, ADIRS, and EIS Integrated Panel.Â  â According to the company, the first early-bird batch of A111, A112, and A113 units sold out within 2 days, and further production slots are now available. Each module is built with full-scale dimensions, dedicated hardware controls, and support for Microsoft Flight Simulator, via Rowsfireâs own interface layer.  The panels are intended to drop into existing desktop or shell cockpits, offering a more realistic alternative to mouse-driven virtual controls while keeping wiring and setup accessible to enthusiasts. Further details on pricing, availability, and the new panels can be found on the official website of Rowsfire. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>SoFly Confirms December Release For AeroTone Audio Enhancer</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SoFly has confirmed that AeroTone, its new audio enhancement add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, will release on Dec. 17, 2025.Â  The product was previously announced under the working title Aircraft Sound Enhancer, and has since been renamed and expanded. AeroTone is built around a custom in-sim panel that runs entirely inside the simulator, with no need for external tools. From this panel, users can adjust individual sound layers, fine-tune levels, and save profiles per aircraft.Â  Settings are stored and recalled from within the cockpit, so you can switch between aircraft and keep separate sound setups without additional configuration. On the audio side, SoFly has partnered with Echo19 to create a high-quality soundscape that reacts to the aircraft and environment. Ground roll, vibration, airframe stress, turbulence, touchdown effects, and avionics noise are all driven by in-sim conditions, with separate treatments for cockpit and cabin views.Â  AeroTone is compatible with every aircraft and vehicle by default, while more than 120 official profiles will ship at launch for popular types. Simmers can also create their own profiles, reset back to an official or community preset if needed, and import community-created configurations.Â  The intention, according to SoFly, is to make AeroTone easy to use for beginners, while still offering enough depth for those who wish to customise every detail. AeroTone also includes regionalised ATC ambience, with many hours of prerecorded chatter, that adapts to your current location and flight phase.Â  Different accent sets cover regions such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, with distinct sets for ground operations and en-route traffic. AeroTone will be available for PC at launch, supporting both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, with game controller support included. SoFly plans to bring the add-on to Xbox and PlayStation 5 via the in-sim Marketplace after the initial release. Pricing has not yet been announced. Learn more here.

    <title>Skyward Simulations Previews Citation C680 Sovereign+ For MSFS24</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a recent Discord post, Skyward Simulations has shared some screenshots and a feature list for their upcoming Citation C680 Sovereign+ for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This will be the team's second project and represents a huge leap for the team. Their first project was the relatively simple Diamond DA-50RG. A far cry from a Citation in both speed and complexity. The team notes how much progress has been made on the new project and promises that a release date announcement is coming soon. So far, the new plane has been confirmed to feature a fully simulated electrical system, anti-ice system, SimBrief integration, checklists, FADEC, autothrottle, EFB, fully modeled interior, G5000 avionics, and much more.Â Â  With their ambitions set so high, hopefully, Skyward Simulations can deliver this beautiful bird to a virtual hangar near you soon. You can check out the full feature list and more on their Discord.Â  Their DA-50RG can be found on the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace and Orbx. It was originally released for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, so it lacks some fidelity on the walkaround, but it still represents an enjoyable experience that will help set your expectations for what is to come. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
