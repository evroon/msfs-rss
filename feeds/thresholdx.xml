    <title>Mango Studios Releases Skiathos International Airport for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-06-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mslgsk"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/684f823e8a3d6ac3b711c010_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Mango Studios has recently released its version of Skiathos International Airport (LGSK) for X-Plane 12. Known for its challenging approach, this Greek airport welcomes over 550,000 passengers annually. Skiathos International Airport first opened its doors in 1972. In 1998, the airport added a passenger terminal and a new control tower. However, this terminal was closed due to a minor earthquake in 2001, and a new terminal was inaugurated just a year later, in 2002. Since 2019, the airport has operated with two terminals: one for international flights and another for domestic flights. Currently, the airport can accommodate aircraft as large as the Boeing 757-200. It serves a variety of airlines, including easyJet, Jet2.com, Olympic Air, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air, among others. These airlines help the airport handle over 550,000 passengers each year, supported by more than 5,000 annual aircraft movements. The scenery features 4K PBR terminals and airport buildings, a fully modelled car park and waterfront, custom runway textures, realistic GSE, a pre-made ortho tile, and much more. The newly released Skiathos International Airport is now available from the X-Plane.Org Software Store for $17.99. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>TDS Sim Software Releases Crossfill for GTN 750Xi/650Xi Units</title>
    <updated>2025-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/750css"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68523601998401abc0b9a01c_gpslol.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. TDS Sim Software has updated their GTN 750Xi add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and X-Plane. The update adds crossfill between the two units, allowing them to talk to each other and exchange data. Contrary to popular belief, Garminâs crossfill function does not only synchronize the active flight plan between two units; it also crosses over fourteen items, such as the flight plan catalog, user waypoints, user-defined frequencies, missed approach acknowledgment, nearest airport criteria, CDI scale, and more. Their crossfill implementation fully replicates the real unitâs behavior, using the same protocols as in real life, ensuring ultimate immersion and fidelity.Â  â For crossfill to work, one must use an aircraft with two GTN units, be it two 750Xi, one 750Xi and a 650Xi, two 650Xis, and so on. Itâs also possible to turn it off if the user wants individual flight plans on each. â To get the functionality working, you should be on the Trainerâs V20.42 version or higher, 1.3.0.0 or higher of the TDN Pro for MSFS 2024, and 1.0.0.4 or higher for X-Plane. â Furthermore, the GTN 750Xi/650Xi is now available in select default MSFS 2024 airplanes, as part of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs SimAttachments feature. Thanks to a mod created by one of their community members, their GPS unit canm now be part of the default Cessna 185 Skywagon, Cessna 404 Titan, and also on the Cessna 172 Skyhawk Classic. â Work is underway to support even more default aircraft in the future: DA40, PC6 Gauge version, DV20, C152, Twin Otter, C207, V35B Bonanza, and H125. â Please refer to their official website for further information.

    <title>Aerosoft Releases Hamburg Airport for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-06-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ham618"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68536e1c6b7e0adbea6a1073_perle1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft recently released their rendition of Hamburg Airport (EDDH) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the Hamburg metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 14.8 million passengers, making it the fifth-busiest airport in Germany. It opened in January 1911, making it the oldest International airport in operation in the world and the second oldest in Germany after Tempelhof, which is now closed. It was given its current name â Hamburg Airport â during the British occupation of Hamburg starting in 1945. Its importance was proven in 1948 when it was an essential part of the Berlin Airlift, where allies carried supplies to West Berlin after the Soviets had blockaded every land access, effectively cutting their supply lines. It was Lufthansa's hub in the mid-50s, although Frankfurt eventually replaced it due to growth constraints that couldn't be overcome. While this did not affect the airport's potential as a non-hub, it could not meet Lufthansa's expectations as a large hub.Â  It wasn't long until the government started discussing the construction of a new airport away from the city and thus not suffering from any potential growth constraints. While the idea seemed nice on paper, they quickly dismissed it due to how bad it was back in the 1960s to have your airport away from the city (transport infrastructure was far from efficient at the time). Thus, they settled with what they had, which could not grow much but was at least within the city's heart and easily accessible.  Furthermore, Lufthansa had already moved to Frankfurt, so the traffic demands were not justifiably high anymore. The 1990s saw extensive modernization work at the airport, including a pier extension, a new terminal, and an airport plaza between the terminals. It's a focus city for Condor, Eurowings, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, airBaltic, Air Cairo, Air France, Air Serbia, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Condor, Croatia Airlines, Emirates, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, TAP, Tunisair, Turkish, Volotea, and Vueling also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, realistic 3D ground, custom aerial imagery, detailed airport buildings, seasons support, 3D vegetation, custom animated vehicles, custom animated jetways, and more. It's available on their shop for $19.99, requiring at least 2.6 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Black Square has released the highly anticipated Starship for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This aircraft was developed in partnership with the owners of the real Starship to ensure the most realistic recreation possible. Development of the Starship began in 1979, and after ten years, in 1989, the first production model took to the skies. Although a total of 50 Starships were built, only six remain airworthy today. The aircraft was groundbreaking for several reasons: it was the first certified canard wing aircraft, the first all-composite structure business aircraft, the first certified twin pusher turboprop, and the first general aviation aircraft to feature an all-glass cockpit. Additionally, it is one of only three civilian turboprop aircraft with a service ceiling of 41,000 feet. The Starship was truly ahead of its time. The aircraft is equipped with numerous features, including an accurate recreation of the Collins avionics suite, a sophisticated pressurisation simulation, and an advanced cabin temperature simulation. It offers 230 potential failure scenarios, a new tablet interface, and much more. These various features contribute to its promotion as one of the most advanced aircraft simulations available for the simulator. The newly released Starship by Black Square is now available from Just Flight for $54.99.Â  â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>BlueBird Simulations Shares 757 Pricing and Beta Plans in Latest Video Update</title>
    <updated>2025-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/bs757p"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/685829e71757547af85458c1_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a new YouTube video, the owner and CEO of BlueBird Simulations, Shervin Ahooraei, has shared a June update on the teamâs upcoming Boeing 757 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The update confirms pricing details and outlines the aircraftâs multi-phase beta roadmap. While development progress is steady, Ahooraei emphasised that a release remains several months away. The passenger variant of the 757, including both the -200 and -300 models, and multiple engine options, will be priced at $80. The aircraft will be compatible with both MSFS 2020 and 2024. It will be available for PC through Just Flight and BlueBirdâs website. The Xbox version is expected several months after the initial release. â âJust because we're comfortable announcing a price doesn't mean we're close to releaseâ, said Ahooraei in the video. âWe're still months away from the next stage of testingâ. Ahooraei also outlined a three-phase beta program, beginning with a small group of testers with extensive experience with the 757. Stage two, described as the most critical, depends on completing the flight management system (FMS), which Ahooraei acknowledged is still several months away due to its complexity. The final stage will open for broader testing, allowing access for all users. Recent development efforts have focused on a comprehensive rework of the pneumatic system, enabling a more authentic engine start process and failure simulation. BlueBird has implemented functional air-ground logic and the 757âs engine electronic control (EEC) computer, while completing significant work on flight controls, using custom code. Over 450 custom sound samples are now integrated into the cockpit, and although the virtual cabin is beta-ready, additional cabin features are not currently a priority. Looking ahead to FlightSimExpo 2025, BlueBird Simulations will exhibit for the first time, with a fully equipped 10x20 booth showcasing the 757. Attendees can try the aircraft hands-on using a dedicated hardware setup, featuring peripherals from Thrustmaster and WinWing.Â  â Ahooraei reiterated the teamâs long-term vision and commitment to quality: âThe goal is to be a top-tier developer, and the 757 is just the beginning.â BlueBird also reaffirmed work on its Boeing 767, beginning with the -300ER variant. Handled by a separate team, the project doesnât impact 757 development, but draws from shared resources and an established codebase, which is expected to speed up development. No release date has been announced, and Ahooraei was clear in managing expectations: âWeâre here for the long haul. Weâre not going anywhere.â FlightSimExpo 2025 begins on 27 June in Providence, Rhode Island.Â  â For all the latest updates, be sure to follow Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Majestic Software recently shared the first in-game previews of their upcoming Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is being âaggressively worked on.â The developer clarified it is still an early work-in-progress preview, and the model being displayed is far from final and undergoing a rebuilding process. Further development updates will come as âthey deem necessary,â and there is no information about pricing, features, or a potential release date. Majesticâs Q400 was one of the most detailed add-ons during the Microsoft Flight Simulator X/Prepar3d era. It featured a completely external flight model that could accurately replicate the behavior of a propeller engine and a deep system simulation across different versions. For a premium, the user could settle for either an A to B plane with no failures or a near-complete training suite.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

It will be available in peopleâs virtual hangars on July 10 as an MSFS Marketplace exclusive. âAfter countless late nights, endless reworks, a few are we there yet moments, and more caffeine than any doctor would recommend - the C750 is ready for takeoff on July 10â, they said at the start of their announcement post on Discord. âWe know it has been a long road, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and support from this community. Weâre excited to finally get it into your handsâ. The Cessna 750 Citation X is a mid-size business jet produced by Cessna, announced in October 1990 and first flown in 1993, with its certification following 3 years later. It used an entirely new design compared to the previous Citations, with commonality only being maintained around some cockpit controls, the windshield, and the tail light bulb. It incorporated many innovative design features for the time, such as the large diameter of the engine intakes, reducing the noise, and improving fuel efficiency. The highly swept wing with a supercritical airfoil increased its top speed, making it faster than all the previous generations.Â  â The design process also involved making it as aerodynamically efficient as possible, trying to minimize drag and, thus, improve its overall efficiency. The innovative wing design was part of that thought process during the development. â Itâs powered by two Rolls-Royce AE 3007Cs with either 6442 or 6764 lbs of thrust, allowing it to cruise at 972 km/h, covering up to 3,460 nautical miles of range, at up to 51,000ft.Â  â FlightFXâs rendition features an accurate simulation of the Primus 2000 flight suite, full VNAV, a custom FADEC with an optional VNAV-coupled auto-throttle, two variants: winglet or no-winglet with their respective performance impact, a real-time EPB system for dynamic engine performance modeling, a deeply modeled pressurization, environmental, hydraulic, electrical, fuel, and ICE systems, full RTU and autopilot capability, realistic IRS, CAS, engine sync, and more. Their custom Electronic Flight Bag features Navigraph and OpenStreetMap integration, a SimBrief-linked load manager, active noise reduction, a ground services manager, and an options customizer (auto-throttle, LCD/CRT toggle, etc.). â The airplane also features wing flex, enhanced lighting inside and out, realistic clutter and cabin details, and dynamic registration on the placard and covers. â The audio was recorded on-site in California, with real APU, engine, mechanical, chime, and cabin interaction sounds. â The add-on is releasing on July 10, exclusively at the Marketplace for $29.99.

The full changelog follows below: AOC Service: Systems Improvements: Model Updates: Sound Enhancements: ATSU Updates: Furthermore, FSLabs has added a free hardware interface for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing seamless integration between their two products and selected high-end hardware, starting with full support for the Skalarki product line. From the mini overhead panel to the DCDU, the interface allows plug-and-play functionality, aiming to deliver an immersive and highly authentic experience. It can be seen live and in action at FlightSimExpo 2025 at Skalarkiâs booth (stand 116). They conclude the blog post on the update with a brief progress update on the PWs, which is said to be coming soon, and they have been hard at work at properly integrating it, from its very unique âwhale-likeâ sound to how it performs and flies, being more than just a different 3D model. The update is only available on their experimental channel for the time being. Users can switch to the experimental branch by heading over to the settings page of their Control Center (in right corner of the settings page).  â Their A321ceo and neo are available for $69.95 each + VAT on their website.
