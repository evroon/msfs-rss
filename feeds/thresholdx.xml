    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSMuseumâs 747 Classic, initially meant for Flight Simulator 2004, appears to be getting a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version instead, with a custom 3D flight deck modeled by arwasairl. The incomplete renders of the flight deck reflect a 747-200B with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4G2 engines, FFRATS, Triple autopilot, Dial gauges, US weights with metric temperatures, and a Kollsman altimeter. Other variants are planned, including dual autopilot, taped displays, corrected engine scales, etc., and will be developed after the current variant is fully completed.Â  The 747 Classic project was first announced in 2020, and had been in development for six years prior, featuring a fully featured FDE with realistic damping, control, stability, and mach effects, and fine-tuned according to Boeing and NASA documents for all phases of flight. The load station data is also directly from Boeing weight and balance documents, with exact locations for MAC, LEMAC, Cargo, PAX, fuel tanks, and landing gear (including suspension).Â  It also features an accurate simulation of the electrical and fuel systems, working in accordance with Boeing specifications with correct loads and transfer rates.Â  â However, itâs important to note that the feature list reflected the project for Flight Simulator 2004, meaning things could have changed since then.Â â Refer to FSMuseumâsÂ original threadÂ for further information on the project. Arwasairlâs cockpit previews are availableÂ here. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. V Pilot Designs has recently released the upgraded version of their Rafael NuÃ±ez Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers. It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots. â By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country. Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed models, PBR materials, custom lighting, custom POIs (points of interest), and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $16.99. V1 owners are eligible for a discounted rate by buying the âSKCG V1 Improvementâ package.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes New 737/777 Development Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777046"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6610eb3ab25734dbc3450d08_777apr1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published another development update for Microsoft Flight Simulator, covering a new 737 lineup update to mitigate a camera issue and a couple of new 777 flight deck previews. The fixes are related to a mechanism within the 737 that handles the viewpoint when data is entered into the tablet. They found out that under certain conditions, the camera could get stuck during that process, making it seem as if the simulator is frozen, while it is, in fact, just the camera acting up. After a lot of research and replication, their tablet team engineered a fix and pushed the update right away, which is already available via the PMDG Operations Center. The update might take a while to appear on the marketplace as they are still completing their intake process on the previous build.Â  Randazzo has shared three new images of the upcoming 777-300ER flight deck, emphasizing that it does not represent the final product and is merely a work in progress.Â  It demonstrates some of the "wear and tear" they mentioned during the previous (Jokeless April Fools) development update, with high-touch areas being "polished" by oily fingertips after twelve years of heavy usage. â While the surveyed airplane is, in fact, relatively old, it was treated with care, meaning the wear isn't as accentuated as one could imagine, being mostly natural wear that inadvertently happens regardless of the nature of the usage. â They have also included dust and crumbs, which accurately represent an airplane that has been actively used for so long.Â  â PMDG also confirms it will be possible to open the cockpit door and wander around the cabin, with dynamic sounds that will change according to your position in the airplane. Nocturnal screenshots were taken but discarded because they showed slight artifacting upon compression, according to Randazzo, which also drew an interesting parallel with taking night photos of your dog and how the picture doesn't have the same personality as they do in person. "Dark scenes in MSFS are the same way. In person they look spectacular, but in still images they often look artifacted and cloudy", concluded Robert. The movable lights on the flight deck can be moved about and pointed wherever one wants, like their 737s.Â  The PMDG 737 lineup is available in theirÂ store, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $69.99. The upcoming 777-300ER's pricing and release date are yet to be revealed. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Axonos has recently released their rendition of Richmond International Airport (KRIC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Sandston, Virginia, and has a yearly average of 4.7 million passengers, making it the busiest in Central Virginia and third-busiest in the state, only behind Washington Reagan and Washington Dulles. Its history dates back to 1927 when it was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field in honor of Richard E. Byrd, brother of the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.Â  A terminal building designed by Marcellus Wright and Son was built in 1950. Expansion work, including the current passenger concourses, was conducted between 1968 and 1970. The early 2000s saw impressive growth figures, leading to a complete redesign of the terminal, which added ten gates, extra parking spaces, and a new air control tower. It also included a complete revamp of the terminal building and the construction of a central utility plant. The two-year project was concluded in 2007. It was expanded again in 2018, two years after it recorded its second-highest yearly passenger volume, with the gate count going from 22 to 30. It was concluded three years later, in 2021. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, detailed 3D modeling, static aircraft (optional), custom jetways, custom ground clutter, realistic night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, and a custom GSX profile. â Itâs available in theirÂ storeÂ andÂ OrbxDirectÂ for $14.99 and $16.45, respectively. To install the scenery, you need at least 1.04 GB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
