    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimPixel has recently released their version of Bari Karol WojtyÅa Airport (LIBD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport is located in the Italian city of Bari, about 5 miles from the city center. In 2023, the airport handled just under 6.5 million passengers, making it the 10th busiest airport in Italy. The airport was originally built as a military airfield and opened in the 1930s. It was seized during the Second World War and began receiving civil flights in the 1960s. Alitalia was one of the first airlines to fly to the airport, offering routes to Rome, Catania, Palermo, Ancona, and Venice. In 1981, a new passenger terminal was built, and in 1990, the airport underwent a runway extension and terminal upgrade. Another renovation took place in 2000, resulting in the construction of a new passenger terminal, which was completed in 2005. Today, the airport serves as a hub for various airlines including easyJet, Ryanair, and Volotea, offering a wide range of destinations across the world. With approximately 6.5 million passengers and 50.000 aircraft movements yearly, the airport continues to be a vital transportation hub. The newly released version of Bari Karol WojtyÅa Airport boasts a range of features, such as high-resolution textures, custom 3D models, dynamic lighting, detailed interiors, static aircraft, ground vehicles, and more. The add-on requires 2.94 GB of storage space and is available on iniBuilds for around $16.7. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>XWind Studios Announces Trenton-Mercer Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66bfa7fb66a9852f1acfe6e7_trenton1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently announced the development of Trenton-Mercer Airport (KTTN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This joint civil-military airport serves Trenton in New Jersey and has a yearly average of 917,000 passengers. The airportâs history is more than a century old. Its first airplane landing was in 1907 when it was just a small airfield on Alfred Reederâs farm. It was opened to the public in 1929 as Skillman Airport. It was used for aircraft testing during World War 2 when a nearby General Motors factory switched from building cars to Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers for the United States Navy. The facility was greatly expanded to accommodate the testing needs. After the end of the war, it was returned to the county and renamed Mercer County Airport. However, it remained partially military, with a Naval Air Warfare Center, which only closed in 1997. The airportâs name was changed again in 1995 to its current name (Trenton-Mercer Airport), after the city of Trenton, which is the state capital and county seat of Mercer County. Many plans were made to replace the old terminal, which residents along the flight path opposed. As a compromise, they renovated it in 2013, bringing it up to standard.Â  An eventual replacement was finally drafted in 2021, considering environmental concerns, and with 125,000 square feet of total area instead of 24,780 from the old one. FAA approved the project a year later, and the terminal was set to reach completion by mid-to-late 2024, but construction had yet to start by May 2024.Â  Itâs served by Frontier Airlines, with flights to Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa.Â  â The scenery will feature custom ground textures, custom buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, and more.Â  Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator, GulfportâBiloxi International Airport (KGPT). Situated in Gulfport, Mississippi, the airport serves the Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area and accommodates just over 685.000 passengers annually. In 1942, the airport opened as a training field for the United States Army Air Forces. Originally named Gulfport Army Airfield, it served as a training field until 1946, when it was placed into reserve status. In 1949, the airport was transferred to the City of Gulfport to be used as a civil airport. Passenger and cargo services started in the early 1950s. Since the transformation into a civil airport, the facility has been operated by a variety of airlines, including American Eagle, Breeze Airways, and others, offering flights to destinations such as Las Vegas, Tampa, and Atlanta. The airport handles just over 50.000 aircraft movements annually. The scenery includes an accurate airport representation, hand-crafted ground textures, dynamic lighting, highly detailed models, and more. The newly released scenery is now available on Orbx for approximately $12.33 and requires around 2.40 GB of disk space. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Announces Release Window for A319 &amp; A321 Expansion</title>
    <updated>2024-08-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/1921rw"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66c0d7894ca0c3305ad044b4_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After their recent introduction of the upcoming Fenix A319 &amp; A321 expansion, the team has just released a new post featuring a variety of liveries and art previews. The developer has also provided details about the release window for the new expansion. The team has rebuilt the fuselage textures from the ground up for the new expansion. For example, the A319 will now have stronger skin deformation on the airframe due to being in a higher pressurisation cycle state. The team has also provided a screenshot clearly showing these changes both below and above the cockpit windows on the A319. Additionally, the team informed us about their decision to offer both dual overwing exit and single overwing emergency exit options on the A319. This choice was made to provide users with the most realistic experience, allowing them to replicate real-life aircraft configurations used by specific airlines. Implementing this new option required the team to update reflections on the ECAM, cabin artwork, wing layout, and other related aspects. When it comes to the A321, the team had to make a decision. This time, the choice was between a two-class or single-class layout for the A321. Again, the team decided to include both layouts and the option to change between them, similar to the A319's overwing exit option. The team has confirmed that the new window textures are included, along with the unique double-slotted flaps on the A321. Additionally, they have shared a video comparing the full TOGA on the various aircraft versions with their respective CFM versions. As of now, the livery manager boasts a total of 450 liveries, with even more on the way. Lastly, the team has announced that the highly anticipated A319 &amp; A321 expansion will launch next week. Once more information is available, or the expansion has been released, Threshold will keep you updated. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries recently released their rendition of Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport (RPVA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. This airport serves Tacloban, the Philippines, and has a yearly average of 1.5 million passengers.Â  It was constructed as an airstrip for the US Air Force during World War 2, housing multiple bombing and fighter units throughout the conflict. It was converted into a commercial airport soon after and renamed from San Jose Airstrip to Tacloban National Airport. In late 2013, Typhoon Haiyan demolished the terminal and the control tower, leading to a reconstruction effort. A few days later, it reopened for turboprop aircraft, and by November 14, it could already welcome narrowbody jets such as the 738 and A320. The passenger terminal was expanded in 2017 to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, adding 1,100 square meters of floor area and an additional 275 seats in the pre-departure area, raising the total to 635. This sufficed for at least three simultaneous flights, whereas it could just barely handle two beforehand. Approval for the construction of a new terminal, capable of handling up to 1,670 passengers/hour, was granted in 2020. Construction started that same year and is halfway complete as of early 2023.Â  Itâs served by Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, PAL Express, and Philippines AirAsia. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom POIs, custom ground clutter, custom interiors, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.66, requiring at least 3.76GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>SoFly Announces Cardiff Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/flycwl"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66c7c6035adad60c48e07851_cardiff1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SoFly has recently announced the development and imminent release of Cardiff Airport (EGFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Cardiff, Wales, with a yearly average of 859,000 passengers. It was built as RAF Rhoose in 1941 and started operations a year later as the home grounds for the No 53 Operational Training Unit, which trained future Spitfire pilots for World War 2 and beyond. It was abandoned right after World War 2, only to be brought back to life in the early 1950s after the Minister of Civil Aviation brought up his wish to build an airport in South Wales. After much deliberation between the options, they decided to repair the abandoned RAF station and invest whatever was necessary to convert it into a commercial airport.Â  It was then inaugurated in 1952 as Rhoose Airport, with Aer Lingus being the first to start scheduled commercial service routes from their base in Dublin. Flights from the former main airport in Cardiff (Pengam Moors) were transferred to Rhoose in 1954, featuring flights to France, Belfast, and Cork.Â  In early 1965, the airport was transferred to Glamorgan City Council, which started a five-year development plan that included a new tower, a new terminal building, and a runway extension. The runway was further extended in the 1980s, marking its renaming as Cardiff-Wales Airport. The new extension attracted British Airwaysâ attention, as it could accommodate their Boeing 747s for maintenance.Â  â A 100 million pound development strategy was announced in 2005, aiming to extend and upgrade the terminal. It was anticipated that it would attract up to 5 million passengers within a decade, a 150% increase. Only 3 million pounds were actually spent, half funded by the Welsh Government, refurbishing and redeveloping the passenger terminal. Further upgrade work was carried out in 2017 at an extra 4 million pounds. â Aer Lingus, KLM, Loganair, Play, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Vueling serve it. â The upcoming scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with an animated hangar, full GSX compatibility, highly detailed custom models, custom ground texturing, custom terminal interiors, and more. â Itâs set to release next Thursday (the 29th) for roughly $15.71.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The X-Plane developer software âWorldEditorâ has just received an update. The main portion of the update is set to bring new features for X-Plane scenery developers. The software is a key tool for devs, allowing them to modify and customize existing airports in X-Plane. One of the features to come with this update is the ability to now offer dual jetways. Each jetway can be assigned to a door on the aircraft, reducing the chances of jetways clipping through each other. In addition, devs can also export polygonal data (with exclusions) to third-party software to help design custom scenery elevations. Other minor updates include Shape Entities, Non-integer spacing for strings and tiles shader effects on ground textures. Finally, the team have added the feature to manually create 3D terrain. This feature was showcased on the iconic island of Saba and St Barths in the caribbean. Both airports have terrain around them that causes difficultly when departing or arriving. With all these new features, we can hope to see new sceneries being created for X-Plane, with high quality and exciting new options.Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news, and remember to join our Discord Server!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After receiving the trailer in April this year, Areosoft has been hard at work developing their rendition of Frankfurt Main Airport. The team have released the second part of their interview to discuss progress. The video showcases the terminal interiors, airfield night lighting and some features that lie to the south of the airport. The video started with the team discussing how important being in touch with the real airport has been in development. The connection allowed them to stay accurate throughout the ground layout. The interior of an addon scenery plays an important role in improving the level of detail. 3D interiors create a depth of feel when pilots are parked on the stand. The team mentioned that it will not be 100% accurate as that level of detail will require an increase in resources and a reduction in performance. In addition, time spent modelling interiors could be spent on other finer details of the airport. The next portion of the video discusses night lighting. One challenge they faced was the vast amount of lights to be placed around the airport and the location they have. An interesting fact is that Frankfurt features over 40 different floodlights. Each has been modelled differently by the team. An approach into Runway 25R, will showcase the vast terminal and perimeter lighting system. The final portion of the video showcased some of the features you can find to the south of the airport. The largest apron is used by the Lufthansa Technical team, with most of the maintenance on Lufthansas fleet taking place there. Also, a new general aviation ramp to the southwest of the airport allows the flow of small aircraft operations. As the team close in on development, we will keep a close eye on the progress and make sure to provide the latest news!Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold and join our Discord Server.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Black Square recently released a major update for their TBM 850 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The aircraft has been updated to version 1.3. The new update includes numerous new features and bug fixes. Some of the most notable features in the update include a new tablet interface, added wing flex, improved de-icing visuals, functional weather radar gain, and much more. This new major update has given the aircraft a variety of new features, making it as realistic as possible. The new version also includes numerous bug fixes. Due to the large number of fixes, we have included the complete changelog for the entire update below: â v1.2 - Major Update: Tablet, Exterior Elements &amp; RNAV Autopilot â â New Features: â - NEW TABLET INTERFACE!Â  The same great tablet interface youâve come to enjoy in the Black Square Dukeâs added to the Black Square TBM 850 for free.Â  Configuring options, hot-swapping avionics, payload settings, failure management, from the tablet, with real time visualizers for engines, electrical schematics, and environmental systems. - Improved environmental system accuracy necessary for the tablet visualizer - Exterior elements available via the tablet interface, such as pitot covers with âRemove Before Flightâ flags that blow in the wind, engine covers, wheel chocks, and external power cart. - Improved external power logic for use with the exterior elements options on the tablet. - Wing flex added. - The KNS80 RNAV unit is now capable of controlling the autopilot when no GPS is selected as the primary radio. Â  See the âUsing the KNS-80 RNAV Navigation Systemâ for more information. - Added turbine engine specific failures enabled by the improved engine simulation required for the tablet visualizer, such as compressor stall and surging, P2.5 bleed valve failures, and fuel control unit failures. - Improved deicing visuals on the exterior model.Â  Ice will now break off of the leading edge of the wings only where there are boots, and melt slowly from heated surfaces. - Added SU15 ground handling parameters. - Added functional weather radar gain, controlled by the existing gain knob. - New sections added to the manual on the tablet interface, and control inputs and output variables, extending the manual from 109 to 160 pages.Â  Enjoy! - More equipment temperatures are now calculated for display on the tablet. - Instant Beta on Touchdown option added to the tablet interface.Â  Due to hardware deadbands, Black Square aircraft do not enter propeller beta range after touchdown if the hardware controller was already in the beta range before touchdown.Â  Enabling this option will apply full beta after touchdown to begin slowing the aircraft without the need to âbumpâ your hardware throttle. - Added true Pitch Sync functionality to yoke CWS buttons.Â  Pressing and holding âL:var_PilotCwsâ or binding âK:SYNC_FLIGHT_DIRECTOR_PITCHâ to hardware controls will now allow the aircraft to be maneuvered in pitch while temporarily disabling the autopilot pitch servo. - A persistent tablet option has been added for a static tablet position more comfortable for VR users.Â  The option, titled âVR Tablet Static Positionâ will affix the tablet in a location farther away from the camera, obscuring as little instrumentation as possible. - Improved propeller governor simulation for smoother speed adjustments when testing overspeed limiter, and propeller governor failure is now gradual. - Added a visual detent to the power lever to indicate the flight idle position, as already exists in the Turbine Duke. - Reverse compatibility for VATSIM clients that use âCOM RECIEVE ALLâ for monitoring COM2 audio while transmitting on COM1. - Added emissive light source on the overhead panel lighting posts. - High bleed air flow torque performance reduction simulated. - Added support for 0.5 kHz ADF frequency tuning on the KR 87.Â  A secondary click on the power knob will increment the standby frequency by 0.5 kHz, which will indicate on the display with a small dot to the left of the frequency. - PMS50 WTT Mode has been integrated natively, so no additional packages are required to enjoy the advanced autopilot features available with the PMS50 GTN 750 as the primary source of navigation. - L:Var outputs have been added to all annunciator lights for use with home cockpits. - Added support for WeatherSquare 4000. â â Bug Fixes: â - Finally!Â  There is a solution for the simulatorâs internal rounding error when setting COM frequencies above ~134 MHz.Â  These frequencies will now work properly with 3rd party air traffic control clients in all Black Square Aircraft. - Gas generator vs. density altitude curve corrected for throttle response. - ITT and torque curves adjusted for more correct limiting factors at altitude. - Parasitic drag scaler increased by 1%.Â  High altitude cruising speeds are now correct to the knot based on POH tables. - Dynamic oxygen consumption was erroneously using the outside air pressure, rather than the interior cabin pressure to calculate the biological oxygen requirement.Â  Oxygen consumption in a partially pressurized cabin will now be substantially reduced. - Fixed several oversights in the electrical system pertaining to the essential bus tie. - Fixed annunciator panel test logic so active annunciators do not illuminate when the currently tested circuit does not have power. - Fixed GPS OBS setting with EHSI course knob when using WT GNS and PMS50 GTN. - Engine Trend Monitor shaft horsepower and specific fuel could read slightly high when ram air pressures were low. - RNAV distance would wind up to 999.9nm when a valid DME station was tuned, but the aircraft was on the ground.Â  This was due to interpolation added for autopilot control. - Performance fix for when both PMS50 GTN 750 and TDS GTNxi 750 are installed. - The autopilot would not follow the NAV2 VOR course deviation when selected on the EFS 40 EHSI in some circumstances. - Volume knob momentary push on the TDS GTNxi was producing âKnob Stuckâ warning. - Airframe deicing controller circuit breaker was not tripping with failure. - Torque will no longer diminish at middle throttle settings when using time acceleration. - Overtorque annunciator warning and ETM exceedence redline adjusted. - Annunciator panel test switch inverted to test correct circuit. - Elevator control sensitivity reduced at low dynamic pressures. - VR Pilot Camera position set to match non-VR pilot viewpoint by default. - Fixed secondary GNS 530 com volume knob incorrect animation name. - Fixed COM 1 KX155 volume knob animation that had a lower maximum position than the COM 2 KXX155. - Increased glareshield light emissive intensity. The updated TBM 850 is now available for download and can be purchased at Just Flight for $41.99.Â  â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
