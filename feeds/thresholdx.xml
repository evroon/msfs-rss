    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Myrtle Beach International Airport (KMYR) for X-Plane 12, serving Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with a yearly average of 3.3 million passengers. It was built on property from a former air base, transferred by the government through the Surplus Property Act. Initially, the city of Myrtle Beach did not want to use the property for an airport, but the funds had to be used for an airport, which meant they funded Horry County Airport instead for 18 years. It wasnât until 1977 that the city annexed the area of Myrtle Beach Airport, with the airport and the Air Force Base sharing the same runway until 1993 when the AFB closed, and the portions of the former military flight line were turned over to the County. Myrtle Beach became an international airport in 1996 and got a brand new passenger terminal for that exact purpose. Twelve years later, it underwent two major renovation projects to modernize the infrastructure. Itâs currently undergoing expansion work, with six new gates being added to Terminal A, bringing the total number of gates to 18 and significantly increasing the traffic handling capabilities. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines currently serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, custom autogen, high-resolution PBR ground textures, animated car traffic, 4K textures, 3D grass, color-graded satellite imagery, HDR night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ Verticalsim ShopÂ for roughly $14.99, and X-Plane 11 users are eligible for a $9.99 upgrade fee.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Kefalonia International Airport (LGKF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Kefalonia, Greece, with a yearly average of 817,216 passengers. It was opened in 1971 to serve the municipality of Leivatho, which no longer exists. A decade later, a new runway and the former main passenger terminal were built. The airport was privatized in December 2015 as part of a government plan to privatize some of their airports, in a batch with 13 other regional airports. A joint venture between Fraport AG/ Copelouzos Group won the concession to operate the entire batch for 40 years as of April 2017. The new operators heavily upgraded the airport, constructing a new passenger terminal building and modernizing the infrastructure with new check-in desks, security lanes, and a larger airside space with more shops. Aegean Airlines (year-long), Air Serbia, Animawings, Austrian Airlines, Avanti Air, British Airways, Condor, Discover Airlines, easyJet, ITA Airways, Jet2.com, Marathon Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Peopleâs, Ryanair, Sky Express, Smartwings, Transavia, TUI Airways, TUI fly Netherlands, Tus Airways, Volotea, and Wizz Air serve it.

    <title>iniBuilds Teases Upcoming London Luton Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inilut"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66048a447bad63a31734918e_luton2.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently teased the development progress on their rendition of London Luton Airport (EGGW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Greater London, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, and Cambridgeshire with a yearly average of 13.3 million passengers, making it the fifth busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Opened in 1938, Luton was of great importance to the Royal Air Force during World War 2, with commercial activities only resuming seven years after the conflict.  Luton was pivotal to developing the package holiday business in the UK, amounting to a fifth of all holiday flights in the United Kingdom by 1969, leading to a major expansion plan in the subsequent decade to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic figures.  Fate might have been a bit cruel to Luton, as the figures dipped massively in the 1980s, leading to the addition of âLondonâ to its name to emphasize its proximity to the capital. â While the extra traffic did, in fact, come during the 1990s, it was in no way due to the renaming strategy, but by embracing charter operators and low-cost carriers such as Debonair and easyJet, which transformed it into the fastest growing major airport in the country.  â The rapid growth was rewarded with an 80 million pound investment program, which improved its infrastructure and facilities. It was followed by the construction of a 40 million pound terminal in 1999, opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip, housing 60 check-in desks and a range of commercial outlets. Six years later, the departure and arrival lounges were redeveloped at the cost of 38 million pounds. â Further development was conducted in 2018 at the cost of 160 million pounds, including new shops, a new boarding pier, and more boarding gates, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 18 million a year.  â Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air UK, which, aside from Dan Air, El Al, FlyOne, and SunExpress, are the only ones that serve the airport, making it a full LCC-centric hub.  â Thereâs no information on the release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>JustFlight Announces BAe 146 V2 Update</title>
    <updated>2024-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfbae2"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66056d4e069cd4c2780e8f0c_Screenshot%202024-03-28%20083822.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. JustFlight has announced a new update for BAe 146 Professional for MSFS on social media. This update will be free of charge for all customers on both PC and Xbox. The update will be available on the 1st of April. This update will bring users the highly-requested UNS-1. The FMS will feature a unique interface of the real unit along with the holding pattern, direct to, and command heading functions, TOD calculations based on target VS, navigation monitoring, real-time performance information, support for SID and STAR, as well as the ability to import and export flight plans.  An in-depth manual for UNS-1 that contains all its features will be provided with the update.  The WT ProLine 21 that was included in v1 will still be available in the new update, and the two types of the FMS can be changed in the EFB. A brand new, high-detailed passenger cabin will also be present in v2. Each version of BAe146 will receive a new cabin design, followed by fully interactive FWD and AFT galleys (yes, the coffee maker is functional!), cabin lighting controls, cabin calls, and ground service electrical supplier simulation. Another interesting feature is a music player - it comes with 7 music tracks that can be controlled by the user. Players will be able to import their custom music through the cabin speakers. A new boarding simulation will be added in the update. The EFB will now feature several different boarding/deboarding speeds, ranging from instant to realistic. For instance, boarding a fully loaded BAe 146-300 could take up to 20 minutes! During boarding, you can hear new passenger boarding sounds. GSX profiles for each variant will be included. Another highly-requested feature is a paper clipboard instead of the modern EFB. Unfortunately, it will take some time to convert all the functions of EFB to the clipboard, but JF has announced that they have started working on that. This update will feature something rustic though, as pilots will be able to use a paper checklist on the yoke, which can have up to 15 pages, and the paper charts that are stored in the charts holder will hover over the top pedestal after being clicked on. Up to 20 charts can be stored, and custom checklists and charts can be imported by placing PNG images in the necessary folder. The new update will also feature three new default liveries for the -200 and -300 variants.

    <title>iniBuilds Releases London Luton Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6606f1e13e5286d1e071ebf1_luton1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of London Luton Airport (EGGW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Greater London, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, and Cambridgeshire with a yearly average of 13.3 million passengers, making it the fifth busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Opened in 1938, Luton was of great importance to the Royal Air Force during World War 2, with commercial activities only resuming seven years after the conflict. Luton was pivotal to developing the package holiday business in the UK, amounting to a fifth of all holiday flights in the United Kingdom by 1969, leading to a major expansion plan in the subsequent decade to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic figures. Fate might have been a bit cruel to Luton, as the figures dipped massively in the 1980s, leading to the addition of âLondonâ to its name to emphasize its proximity to the capital. While the extra traffic did, in fact, come during the 1990s, it was in no way due to the renaming strategy, but by embracing charter operators and low-cost carriers such as Debonair and easyJet, which transformed it into the fastest growing major airport in the country. The rapid growth was rewarded with an 80 million pound investment program, which improved its infrastructure and facilities. It was followed by the construction of a 40 million pound terminal in 1999, opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip, housing 60 check-in desks and a range of commercial outlets. Six years later, the departure and arrival lounges were redeveloped at the cost of 38 million pounds. â Further development was conducted in 2018 at the cost of 160 million pounds, including new shops, a new boarding pier, and more boarding gates, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 18 million a year. Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air UK, which, aside from Dan Air, El Al, FlyOne, and SunExpress, are the only ones that serve the airport, making it a full LCC-centric hub. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, high-detail models of all airport buildings and objects, an up-to-date layout, an official GSX profile, LOD optimization, custom static aircraft, and more. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.91, requiring at least 5.31 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
