    <summary>Sim: MSFS. HiFi Simulation Technologies has just announced a long-awaited product for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Active Sky FS. Active Sky FS will come with tons of features ranging from direct MSFS integration to enhanced cloudscapes and the famous Active Sky Weather Engine. ASFS will feature two weather depiction modes, passive and preset weather. Passive weather depiction uses MSFS live weather data, allowing MSFS to take full control of weather depiction. At the same time, ASFS provides active air effects and other features, such as mapping, planning, voice features, condition reports, companion app, and more. Passive depiction is recommended for VFR flying, as it provides better cloud variation. When it comes to preset weather depiction mode, it contains weather condition controls for the best accuracy. It allows for full use of Active Sky weather data features, including real-time, historical, and custom weather options. This mode is recommended for those desiring realism in flight simulators. Active air effects will enhance the simulator with lots of different features, including clear air turbulence, broken and overcast cloud layer turbulence, internal MSFS turbulence compatibility, updrafts, downdrafts, microbursts, thunderstorm effect, gusts, wind variation, gust-related turbulence, and many more. Although ASFS's pricing is not yet determined, it is currently in beta testing and has gotten the status of releasing soon. Support for FS2024 is also planned without an additional fee unless there will be any major re-designs. The release date is currently unknown, but Threshold will keep you updated as always! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently launched its version of Oslo Gardermoen Airport (ENGM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Norwegian capital of Oslo and is situated in the county of Akershus, approximately 47 kilometers from the city. As the biggest and busiest airport in Norway, it welcomes around 30 million passengers annually. Oslo Gardermoen Airport was inaugurated in 1998 as a replacement for the old Oslo Fornebu Airport. The airport's location had been debated since the 1960s and five sites were proposed, with HobÃ¸l initially being selected as the new main airport. However, the government was concerned that HobÃ¸l was too centrally located concerning growth around Oslo, so Gardermoen was chosen instead. Construction of the new airport began, and since its opening, it has grown continuously while replacing Fornebu. Today, Oslo Airport has over 160 destinations, and many airlines fly to and from the airport. Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, WiderÃ¸e, and Norse Atlantic Airways are the four airlines with their hubs in Oslo, while KLM, Air France, Qatar, Emirates, and many others provide a range of destinations. The airport is a hub for both commercial and cargo operations, handling over 240.000 aircraft movements every year. Jo Erlend Sund developed the newly launched version of Oslo Gardermoen Airport, which includes many features such as a highly precise rendition of the airport, detailed models, high-resolution textures, an up-to-date layout, accurate terrain and runway profiles, a dynamic airport environment, custom aerial image, custom lighting, and more. The add-on requires 5GB of storage space and is available on Aerosoft for approximately $22.36. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations and db Scenery have recently released their rendition of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.  â Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. â It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, custom landside, custom terrain mesh, custom ambient sounds, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's available in the MSFSÂ Marketplace for $9. Refer to the product page for further information.  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Imaginesim has recently released the V2 of their Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Singapore with a yearly average of 58.9 million passengers, making it one of the world's busiest.Â  It was inaugurated 42 years ago when the Singaporean government was forced to build a new airport toÂ cope with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel.Â  At first, their original plan was to expand Paya Lebar, the former main airport in Singapore, but the 1973 Oil crisis changed everything. By 1975, they had already decided to build a brand new airport at the eastern tip of the main island of Changi, at the Changi Air Base. After its first year of operation, the airport had already handled an average of 12.1 million passengers, which led to the construction of a second passenger terminal in the 1990s. Terminal 3 soon followed in 2008, and then Terminal 4 in 2017. Terminal 5, which isÂ planned to be larger than all four combined, is expected to open in 2030. â It's a hub for FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, and Singapore Airlines. AirAsia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Hainan Airlines, IndiGo, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Swiss, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-definition textures, performance optimization, custom VDGS, custom animated jetways, 52 square kilometers of total coverage, Terminal 5's construction area, and more. â It's available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $24.75.
