    <title>Orbx Previews Maitland Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-10-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Orbx has recently previewed their upcoming scenery for MSFS - Maitland Airport (YMND). Located in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia, this airport receives no airline service and is mostly used by general aviation.Â  After the airfield near Rutherford had been closed due to urban development, the Royal Newcastle Aero Club moved all of their operations and headquarters to the Maitland Airport in 1963, and five years later, a new runway was added, while between 1972 and 1977, both runways have received expansions and were paved.Â  The only times this airport received airline service were for the brief period in the 1980s when Club Air offered commuter flights to Sydney and in 1988 when Yanda Airlines operated on the same route, until the suspension of their Air Operatorâs Certificate in 2001. This airport is also called Russel Airfield, named in honour of Robert Russel, the President of the Royal Newcastle Aero Club (RNAC) in 1966. Besides the RNAC, it is also the home airfield of Paul Bennet, an Australian aerobatic pilot, known for his varied collection of aircraft and airshows.Â Throughout its history, the Russel Field has also been the host of many airshows and air races. Orbxâs rendition of the Maitland Airport features 3D custom-modelled airport facilities, Paul Bennetâs hangar, highly detailed ground markings, custom animated hangar doors, improved ground textures and terraforming, custom apron, runway and approach lights, and improved vegetation around the airport. Along with the previews of the upcoming product, Orbx has also teased the release of two aircraft: Wolf Pitts Pro (the aircraft used by Paul Bennet), and the TBM Avenger. This rendition will cost 14,99 AUD, which is roughly around 9,90 $. No information about the release date of the scenery, the Pitts Pro or the TBM Avenger has been released, however, as always, Threshold will keep you updated! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has just released another Middle-eastern map for pre-ordering: Iraq. One of the most important parts of the world for air combat in the 20th and 21st centuries finally received its own map. It will cover more than 1,820,000kmÂ² Three versions of this map are available for purchase: Iraq, Iraq North and Iraq South.Â  The map division is the same as with the previous maps, such as Afghanistan. For example, if one buys Iraq North, they will receive the whole map, however, only the northern part of the map (the blue area in the picture) will be of higher detail. The same can be applied to to Iraq South map. The full version of the map will include more detailed areas of both the North and South(green and blue areas), while the rest will be of lower detail. The Iraq North map will cover more than 321,700kmÂ² of the detail area with 17 highly detailed airfields, some of them being: Baghdad Intlâ, Erbil Intlâ, Sulayimaniyah Intlâ, Kirkuk Intlâ, K1 Base, H2/3 Base, Mosul and other. It will cover mostly the territory of Iraq, with smaller parts of Iran and Syria.Â  Its counterpart, the Iraq South map on the other hand covers around 491,500kmÂ² of detailed area with 14 detailed airfields: Kuwait Intlâ, King Fahd Intlâ (Dammam), Bahrain Intlâ, Doha Intlâ, King Abdulaziz (air base near Dammam), Jubail Navalâ¦Â  Unfortunately, the Iraq South Map will not be available for pre-purchasing or early access. The pricing of the maps during the pre-purchase period (ending in Q4 2024) is as follows: After the pre-purchase period ends, the early access -20% discount will only apply to the Iraq map, as the Iraq North map EA price will be the same as the full release price. Eagle Dynamics has released a trailer for the upcoming map on their YouTube channel. If you have any more questions about the Afghanistan map, you may find your answers here. â The Early Access release is expected for Q4 2024, but as always Threshold will keep you updated with new info about the map! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <title>FlyByWire Simulations Releases Airbus A380 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fb380a"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/672403756f57fd8552c33ac1_a380-01.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlyByWire Simulations recently released their long-awaited rendition of the Airbus A380 for Microsoft Flight Simulator in an open alpha stage. It has enough operability for A to B flights, but many systems are still under development.Â  Their goal is to enable access to outside contributors and developers, provide the community with an early look, and actively work on further developing it over time with more features and tweaks. Due to the aircraft's sheer complexity and its current open alpha nature, performance is significantly more demanding than that of most payware aircraft. It requires at least an RTX 4080 Super for 1440p@60 at ultra and at least a GTX 1060 6 GB for 1080p at 30 fps on low settings. The current release (subject to change in the future as it is an early alpha) features a custom flight management system based on their updated fms-v2 implementation, with support for all ARINC424 leg types, holding support, and more. Furthermore, it accurately represents the primary flight display, navigation display, engine and warning display, and system display, with precise MEMOs for numerous systems and integrated checklists for normal and abnormal procedures. It also includes a comprehensive simulation of the core aircraft systems and 140 potential failures, although full simulation is not guaranteed at this development stage. Other features include realistic flight control surfaces, dynamic wing flex, Brake to Vacate capabilities, Runway Overrun Warning/Protection, and OANS (Onboard Airport Navigation System), which aids situational awareness by displaying a virtual airport map.Â  â Regarding future MSFS 2024 compatibility, FlyByWire has stated that it won't be available for the new platform as soon as it is out due to the significant amount of effort required due to differences in system requirements and 3D model optimizations, among other things. They will not be sticking to any specific timeline at the moment. â The A380X is available for free on the FlyByWire installer.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. KiwiFlightSim has recently released their rendition of Rarotonga International Airport (NCRG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Avarua in the Cook Islands, with a yearly average of 350,000 passengers. Built in 1944 by the United States Army Air Forces to support their Pacific campaign, establishing a vital link in the Allied supply chain by facilitating the transportation of troops and supplies to the frontlines, it marked a significant milestone in Rarotongaâs development, opening up the island to the outside world. The 5000-foot-long airstrip remained operational after the war, serving as a stopover point for trans-Pacific flights. It was not until the 1970s that it underwent a major overhaul to properly embrace the jet age and its steeper runway length and ground infrastructure requirements.Â  Twenty-one years ago, the terminal, departure, and check-in areas were heavily revamped to meet modern standards, and six years later, the terminal was reconstructed and expanded to accommodate the new passenger traffic demands. Itâs a hub for Air Rarotonga, and Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetStar also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, custom ground markings, five detailed interiors, detailed surrounding buildings, custom night lighting, custom runway textures, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.29, requiring at least 1.82 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently issued a new update to their Boeing 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The update brings further stability fixes to the Universal Flight Tablet and fixes the broken pushback module from the previous build. The update is already available via the Operations Center for PMDG.com customers, whereas marketplace owners must wait until it goes through Microsoft's intake process. No changelog was provided with the update because of its tiny nature. They have also provided further information on their upcoming Boeing 777F for MSFS 2020 and 2024. As previously mentioned during their last development update, PMDG is unaware of how many changes will be required to function correctly in the new platform. As they waited for that to become clear, they sorted out issues related to the main deck cargo system and thoroughly tested items such as lighting and cargo door controls. It's said to be in great shape regarding operability, but they are taking their time to improve gameplay features they consider essential. In Randazzo's own words, streamers will receive their copy of the upcoming product "shortly." While part of their team works hard on the new triple seven variant, their 747 team is also hard at work on their new project, the Boeing 747-100 (and the -400). PMDG claims to have unprecedented access to a broad range of expertise, which will help make the 747 for MSFS their "lifetime project." They plan out on covering the entire 747 product line for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with the initial entries being the aforementioned 747-100 and the 747-400, but other variants such as the 747SP are also in the plans, and even some special projects like the RA001, Air Force One, and the original test-flight bird. â It is intended to be a love letter to the iconic aircraft, with an enormous amount of effort being put into making it happen. Below is a work-in-progress image of the overhead panel: Their product is available on PMDG.com and in the Marketplace, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TearWearDesigns recently released their rendition of Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (KXNA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. The airport serves Bentonville, Fayetteville, Springdale, and Rogers in Arkansas and has a yearly average of 1.9 million passengers. It opened in late 1998 to replace Fayetevilleâs Drake Field as the regionâs main airport, as the latter was deemed too small to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic demand. After nine years, the airport was expanded for the first time by constructing a new concourse, which increased the number of aircraft parking positions from twelve to twenty. In the 2010s, it was further expanded with an additional 4,700 square meters and twelve upper-level gates, which cost the administration around $21 million. A new concourse project was approved a few years ago. It will allow the airport to use the gates more efficiently and handle a higher passenger traffic volume. The cost estimate for the undertaking is around $35 million to $50 million. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, 3D vegetation, hand-placed night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.98, requiring at least 1.04 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds has released its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator (both 2020 and 2024), featuring Innsbruck Airport (LOWI). This airport, known for its challenging approach, serves the Austrian city of Innsbruck, which is nestled between the Alps. Each year, Innsbruck Airport welcomes over 900.000 passengers. The airport opened in 1925 with the goal of connecting the city to Munich by air. However, it soon became evident how challenging it was to land and take off in an airport surrounded by mountains. The airport played a significant role during the Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck in 1964 and 1976. Over the years, the airport has undergone various upgrades and improvements, enhancing both its capacity and safety for travelers. Today, it offers a range of both year-round and seasonal routes, supported by airlines such as Austrian Airlines, easyJet, and Eurowings, among others. Last year, the airport served 900.000 passengers. The new rendition of Innsbruck Airport features hand-crafted ground textures, an authentic airport landside, dynamic lighting, highly detailed airport buildings, an official GSX profile, and much more. The scenery requires a total of 5.41 GB of storage space and is available for $19.48 on the iniBuilds Store.Â  For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts recently published a new development update concerning their upcoming Embraer Lineage 1000 add-on, a 50 million dollar ultra-large business jet variant of the popular Embraer 190 with an 8500 km range. Cabin texturization is nearing completion. They will next animate the window blinds, cabin doors, and all tables, add customizable lighting throughout the cabin, create a custom fuel system with additional tanks, and add new EFB stuff. Their custom interior will include different zones made with ultra-high resolution materials and heavy optimization work to warrant smooth performance despite the level of detail. Regarding cabin accuracy, the developer claims to have access to a real Embraer Lineage, allowing them to capture each nook and cranny of the aircraft as realistically as possible, with precise dimensions, accurate furniture, and more. While there is no release date yet, X-Crafts expects it to be ready within a few months for X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12. Owners of the complete E-jets Family will receive the new plane for free, whereas new owners can buy it separately. Thereâs also an upgrade path for owners of any individual E-Jet, which warrants access to the whole family for $67.45. Refer to their blog post for further information on the matter and purchase links. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Navigraph Releases SimBrief Dispatch for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/navuix"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6729856646dc65696c3f4105_dispatch1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Navigraph has recently released a new tool for Microsoft Flight Simulator, allowing users to fully utilize SimBrief within the simulator for flight planning, thus removing the necessity to access SimBrief from a web browser. The new integration allows access to most of SimBriefâs flight planning features right from the simulator. It maintains a layout similar to that of the online version, retaining familiarity and ease of use. SimBrief dispatch is free to use and install. It is available through Navigraph Hub for Navigraph customers and through the SimBrief dashboard for all users.Â  Designed to create a seamless and straightforward workflow, the new tool can be launched straight from Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs world map through a button that reads âSimbriefâ above the âFly Nowâ button. Clicking it will open a SimBrief window within the simulator, where you are then prompted to put in your login details and presented with a familiar interface (translated to Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs User Interface design language), where you can generate your flight plan. Navigraph customers will benefit from updated navigational cycles, which will ensure the best possible data match for their flight plan generations. â After the planning stage, users can also launch the SimBrief UI at any moment during their flight by clicking on its toolbar icon. This will display the same interface, allowing for quickly booking a return leg or calculating take-off performance. â Navigraph has also mentioned that a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 version is in the works. This version is planned to be integrated into the simâs global electronic flight bag. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
