    <title>X-Crafts Publishes ERJ Family Development Update for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2024-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/erjx12"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/676228db8f59052d3782d60f_erj1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts recently published a blog post outlining their plans for a future update to its ERJ Family, which will add many new features and be fully compatible with Laminar Researchâs latest flight simulation platform.Â  â The development update begins with a quick explanation of why the ERJs have not seen many updates since their focus shifted to the E-Jets, which required further attention due to their heavy reliance on automation and increased system complexity.Â  â When X-Plane 12 came out, X-Crafts intended on making it compatible as soon as possible, but they quickly realized it was not going to be as straightforward of a job as they thought it would due to how different the new simulator was in some ways, rendering the airplane unusable without workarounds. â Addressing the issues would require a lot of extra work and effort, which made creating a compatibility patch rather unfeasible and illogical, given they could rebuild it instead and make a major upgrade out of it rather than just a mere patch.Â  â They have been working on the ERJ Family v2 upgrade for a while now and feel ready to share how things are progressing and bring a close look at the new features that will accompany the new version. â An industry specialist created the flight model from scratch, fully optimized for X-Plane 12. Real ERJ pilots are currently testing it to ensure it is as accurate as possible within the simulation. Unlike the X-Plane 11 version, where default X-Plane systems drove hydraulics, fuel, and anti-ice systems, v2 will bring custom-made systems and a new and more accurate FADEC system to control the Thrust Rating. The pop-up screensâfamiliar to E-Jets customersâwere also implemented in V2. There is an openable PFD, MFD, and EICAS that can be freely moved around the screen or placed on another display. Autopilot settings can be controlled directly from the pop-up PFD by scrolling while hovering over the values. The nav map has also seen a substantial visual upgrade, with a brand-new, high-resolution display, including the PLAN mode.Â  They are also working on implementing the Electronic Flight Bag from the E-Jets into the ERJs, which will allow users to control ground objects, doors, performance calculations, weight and balance, and more. A secret set of featuresâwhich remains unmentionedâis also in the works. The update will also improve the sounds, taking full advantage of the new audio technologies embedded within X-Plane 12. â Due to the amount of work involved and all the new features, the ERJ v2 Update will not be a free upgrade. They intend to charge a $20 fee for v1 owners, and the base price for new customers will also suffer a slight increase.Â  â There is no release date yet, but X-Crafts plans on releasing the Lineage 1000 first, which is scheduled to come out before the end of February if everything goes according to plan.Â  â Please refer to the original blog post for further information on the update.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds recently published a short statement on the future of their upcoming Airbus A350 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Due to stability and reliability issues with Microsoft's newest flight simulator, they decided to make it also compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. First announced in late 2023, iniBuilds' original intent was to make it available for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 first and later provide a port to MSFS 2024, but a lot has changed since then, and at one point, they decided to make it MSFS 2024 only.Â  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has not lived up to many people's expectations, leading to an increasing number of people begging iniBuilds to consider making it compatible with the olderâand significantly more stableâsimulator.Â  â While the asset streaming idea looked pretty good and promising on paper, its practicality had proven quite questionable after a disastrous release day and the following couple of weeks before things got under control. From not being able to get into the simulator at all to aircraft sounds vanishing halfway through the flight, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 managed to become one of the worst-rated triple-A titles on Steam.Â  â Considering that, iniBuilds decided to release the A350 for both simulators in one purchase, with two distinct development cycles, allowing people the freedom of choice. â They have also briefly hinted at revealing more information about the upcoming product on Saturday (21/12), almost one year after its official announcement.

    <title>TropicalSim Releases Guarulhos International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2024-12-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tsmgru"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6763918853f52013fbc15f42_tsm1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. TropicalSim has recently released their rendition of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, initially with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom night lighting, animated jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $18.88, requiring at least 243.58 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their rendition of Kirkwall Airport (EGPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves the Orkney Islands in Scotland and has a yearly average of 143,000 passengers. Built in 1940 as RAF Grimsetter to defend the Scapa Flow Naval base, taking its name from the homonymous farm it was built over.Â  Three years later, the Royal Navy took over and renamed it Royal Naval Air Station Grimsetter. Control was passed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in 1948 and handed over to an administration company in the mid-1980s, ultimately ending its military roles. Nowadays, Kirkwall Airport serves as a vital connection between the Orkney Islands and the mainland, operating services to Aberdeen, Belfast City, Dundee, Ebay, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, London Heathrow, Manchester, North Ronaldsay, Papa Westray, Sanday, Stronsay, Sumburgh, and Westray through Loganair, which is the only airline serving the airport as of 2024. The airport is home to the Sustainable Aviation Test Environment (SATE), the United Kingdomâs first low-carbon aviation test center. It is helping to pave aviationâs future one test flight at a time. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D-modeled terminal, custom landside buildings and hangars, custom ground textures, custom runway textures, a custom interior, and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $11.99 and is currently compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Once the in-sim marketplace is launched, an MSFS 2024 exclusive version will be available. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Just Flight recently published a new development update on the upcoming Airbus A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, showcasing the night lighting logic in the flight deck and addressing its compatibility with MSFS 2024. The developers are finishing work on the animation and lighting logic for nearly two thousand switches, dials, and annunciator lights. This process required coding each element, verifying its operability within the simulator, and tweaking the animations or artwork further when needed.Â  Their systems coders have made great progress over the last 18 months. They will soon be able to âbring the aircraft to lifeâ as the cockpit artwork and animations are ready. They look forward to sharing systems previews early next year. The exterior has not been previewed yet because it is undergoing work on refining its overall geometry, adding extra details such as panels, lines, wiring around the landing gear, and a detailed cargo hold, to name a few. The modeling has recently reached completion, and texturing is now underway, with previews to come in 2025. Similarly to their upcoming Fokkers, core development will remain on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for now while they wait for greater stability. The commitment to support both simulators remains.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently launched the trailer for their upcoming Airbus A350 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, along with a comprehensive development update listing some of its features and shedding light on a potential release date. As previously covered, iniBuilds decided to make it compatible with 2020 due to stability and reliability issues with Microsoftâs new flight simulator, thus investing in two development cycles under a single purchase and allowing the freedom of platform choice. âWe will do our very best to have parity in feature sets between both versions of the aircraft, but please note this will not be possible all the way, and more details will be shared close to release,â they conclude. The feature list promises a detailed 3D cabin with a cabin announcement system, a comprehensive flight attendant panel, custom terrain radar, detailed systems simulation, Navigraph integration with SimBrief import feature, a situation manager, ABEAM &amp; Offset simulation, intricate 3D model and texturing, GPS jamming, multiple failures, Brake-to-Vacate, and structural vibrations.Â  They claim to have worked very hard to provide a top-tier simulation of its electrical parts and systems, with a full-fledged electrical bus simulation, dynamic load computation, distinct battery options (NiCad or Lithium, with varying capacities and amperage), and noise-optimized N1 settings for NADP procedures. iniBuilds will be commencing their usual Aircraft showcase series on YouTube within the next few weeks, walking people through some of these new features. While the A350 was originally set to be released in 2024, iniBuilds has made the difficult decision to postpone the release to Q1 2025 to warrant a âfantastic product on launch.â Both variants will be available on day one, and the XLR will come at a later date.

If you do not yet own xEnviro, the team is excited to announce a temporary price reduction from $69.69 to $49.69 while they work on restoring all features.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently launched its version of Oulu Airport (EFOU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport, located approximately 6.6 miles from the city center of Oulu, Finland, welcomes around 550.000 passengers each year and handles nearly 6.000 aircraft movements. The airport opened in 1953, following the commencement of construction in 1949. Initially, the airport featured only gravel runways. This changed in 1958 when the runways were paved, and the airport received its terminal and air traffic control (ATC) building. In 1973, the current terminal building replaced the earlier structure, which was later demolished in 2005. The terminal underwent further expansion and renovation in 2002 and 2011. Regarding the runways, the second runway was removed in 2000, shortly after the completion of the current ATC tower in 1998. Today, the airport operates flights from Finnair, Lufthansa, and Aegean Airlines, offering various regular and charter destinations, including Helsinki, Munich, Chania, and Rhodes. The scenery package is filled with features including custom night lighting, custom parking positions, custom surroundings, custom people, PBR materials, and much more. The add-on requires slightly over 1 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for $17.16. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
