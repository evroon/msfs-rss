    <title>SoFly Releases Bristol Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SoFly has recently released their rendition of Bristol Airport (EGGD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the eight busiest airport in the United Kingdom with a yearly average of 10.5 million passengers. Built on top of a former RAF airfield, Bristol Airport was inaugurated in 1957, replacing Bristolâs former main municipal airport (Whitchurch).Â  In 1958, a 200,000-pound passenger terminal was built, part of the administrationâs effort to make it the cityâs de facto airport. Four years later, a new control tower was built. In 1969, the runway underwent its first expansion, and the terminal was extended to handle the predicted figures for the 1970s and beyond. In the early 1980s, despite being served by 17 charter airlines, the airport was operating at a loss until Les Wilson took over as managing director and completely turned the tide. He held this position until his tragic passing in a car accident in 1995.Â  The mid-1980s slight recovery from the crisis allowed the administration to expend an extra dime or two on the construction of a new international departure lounge. Four years later, a new concourse area was opened, and planning for a new terminal kicked into action, leading to its eventual approval in 1994. Work started in 1997, shortly after FirstBus Group bought a 51% stake in the airport, heavily investing in its new infrastructure. The terminal, which cost 27 million pounds, was ready by 2000.Â  Passenger numbers reached the two million mark for the first time that year. A year later, the airport was purchased by a joint venture for 198 million pounds, and 50% of it was sold again in 2006. In 2015, the terminal was expanded again with a larger departure lounge and an outdoor terrace, followed by a new terminal extension adding 9,000 square meters. The project reached completion in 2017. Itâs a focus city for easyJet, Jet2, Ryanair, and TUI Airways. Aer Lingus, Aurigny, Blue Islands, Edelweiss Air, KLM, Loganair, Pegasus Airlines, and Sun Express also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, true-to-life elevation data, full GSX integration with animated doors, a dynamic airport environment, PBR texturing, dynamic seasons, and performance-friendly optimization. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $18.25, requiring at least 3.11 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Got Friends Updates Aeroprakt A-32 Vixxen for MSFS to Version 1.0.1</title>
    <updated>2025-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Got Friends has released version 1.0.1 of its Aeroprakt A-32 Vixxen for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, introducing several improvements. The update refines the aircraftâs flight model, featuring custom propeller and flap drag code. Instrumentation and cockpit visuals have also received attention,Â  including new EGT gauge interactions, more natural glass reflections, and improved lighting behaviour across both analogue and G3X-equipped cockpits. The EFB can now be used even with the battery and avionics switched off, the custom KAP-140 autopilot once again accepts hotkey inputs, and stall, oil temperature, and heading indicator behaviour have all been fine-tuned for better accuracy. Performance has also been improved through LOD optimisations, which should be most noticeable in multiplayer. Several other fixes have addressed smaller issues, including corrected gauge animations, a brighter heading bug, and restored exterior engine audio nodes. The update also adjusts weight station logic, allowing the user to load either a co-pilot or cargo, but not both, to maintain consistent visuals and flight behaviour. As usual, here's the full changelog: You can download the Got Friends Aeroprakt A-32 Vixxen v1.0.1 update now through the Contrail app. TDS users must also update their TDS Expansion to version 1.0.1 for compatibility.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has released its first fully native Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 scenery, bringing 56WV, Cheat River Island, to the new sim. The backcountry strip in West Virginia is situated on a river island, in the Appalachian range, with approaches that wind through a narrow valley, changing weather conditions, and even the occasional turkey on the runway.Â  The MSFS 2024 version has been rebuilt to use the simâs newer tech. That includes high-fidelity 3D models, enhanced textures, a custom asset library, TrailBlazer terrain shaping, dynamic fauna, and bespoke lighting and ambient sounds at the main building. The environment has also been tailored to match the region, featuring custom vegetation and autumn colours. The airfield features a 1,704 ft grass runway, with landings on Runway 30 and departures from Runway 12, a sloped terrain profile, and collision-aware objects surrounding the strip. On the ground, you can explore six miles of drivable roads, built for the //42 Juice Goose UTV, camp overnight with the //42 Campout Utility, or visit detailed micro-scenes, such as a lakeside campsite and a rustic bar, that come alive after dark. Wildlife encounters, ziplines, tractor rides, and even a hidden bear make are also included. The scenery is available now for $12.00 at the Parallel 42 store. Owners of the 2020 version can upgrade to the MSFS 2024 release for $2 by using the code 24CHEATS at checkout. Parallel 42 says the offer is valid for six months, through April 29, 2026.

    <title>iniBuilds Releases Daniel K. Inouye International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has released their rendition of Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL/PHNL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Located to the northwest of Honolulu, it serves the Hawaiian capital and the island of Oahu, with over 21 million passenger operations in 2024. Opened in 1941, it was originally named after a WWI naval officer, John Rodgers. It was the first âfullâ airport in Hawaii, as planes used to land on seaplane docks, small air strips and fields. After the Pearl Harbour attack, the Rodgers Field became the Naval Air Station for Honolulu, and the Navy built the control tower and the first terminal building, where passenger flights were allowed to operate during the daylight. After WWII ended, it was renamed to âHonolulu Airportâ and received the âInternationalâ addition in 1951. Back then, it was one of the largest airports in the USA with four paved runways and three water runways, spanning across 4,019 acres (1,626 hectares). Due to its position, the Honolulu International Airport became a regular stop for all transpacific flights, and by 1950, it became the third busiest airport in the United States, and had the worldâs longest runway (13,097ft/3,097m) in 1953.Â  During the Jet Age, the airport became a frequent stop for various carriers, such as Pan Am, United, Northwest Airlines, Air New Zealand, BOAC, Canadian Pacific Air Lines (later became CP Air), China Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Qantas, Philippine Airlines, TWA, and many more. In 2006, the State of Hawaii unveiled a $2.3 billion plan for modernising Hawaiian airports, out of which $1.7 billion was designated for Honolulu Intlâ Airport. During the period of 15 years, the airport had received many upgrades, including a new concourse for wide-body aircraft, new parking garages, and renovated check-in lobbies and terminal interiors. During the process of airport modernisation, the airport also got renamed to âDaniel K. Inouye International Airportâ, in honour of the late Medal of Honour recipient and U.S. senator, Daniel Inouye. The iniBuilds rendition of the largest airport in Hawaii features hand-made ground textures with crisp, true-to-life airport layout with custom ground decals, modelled terminal interior, signposts, vegetation, and parking barriers, dynamic airport lighting, custom static aircraft, LOD optimisation, and an official GSX profile. The scenery is available for purchase on the iniBuilds store for approximately $26.07, requiring at least 2.72GB of free disk space. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has broken a period of relative silence with a sizeable development update, outlining progress across several ongoing projects and updates for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Leading the update is Helsinki Airport (EFHK), which has officially entered beta testing. According to MK Studios, the release is expected within the next seven to ten days, with the NDA lifting early next week, indicating that new screenshots and streams are likely to follow soon. The Finnish theme continues, as the team also confirmed that Rovaniemi Airport (EFRO) is being reworked. The refreshed version is planned for December, just in time for winter operations, and for those planning a festive visit to Santaâs home turf. Beyond Finland, MK Studios shared progress on Rome Fiumicino (LIRF), noting that modelling exports have begun, and the project is expected to enter beta by the end of November.Â  Meanwhile, VÃ¡gar Airport (EKVG) in the Faroe Islands is undergoing a full rebuild, scheduled for January, featuring a new satellite image, improved terrain, updated buildings and POIs, and a refreshed apron layout, with an additional parking stand. Looking a bit further ahead, Porto (LPPR) and Fuerteventura (GCFV) are both scheduled for complete reworks sometime in Q1 or Q2 2026. The developer also mentioned that work is ongoing on professional training projects alongside these updates, explaining the recent hiatus. Finally, MK Studios issued a call for reference photos of the new Keflavik terminal, both inside and out, to support next yearâs planned update to the Icelandic hub.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Imaginesim has recently released their updated rendition of Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, reflecting the latest changes to the airport. It was inaugurated 42 years ago when the Singaporean government was forced to build a new airport to cope with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel. Initially, their original plan was to expand Paya Lebar, the former main airport in Singapore; however, the 1973 Oil crisis changed everything. By 1975, they had already decided to build a brand new airport at the eastern tip of the main island of Changi, at the Changi Air Base. After its first year of operation, the airport had already handled an average of 12.1 million passengers, prompting the construction of a second passenger terminal in the 1990s. Terminal 3 soon followed in 2008, and then Terminal 4 in 2017. Terminal 5, which is planned to be larger than all four combined, is expected to open in 2030. It's a FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, and Singapore Airlines hub. AirAsia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Hainan Airlines, IndiGo, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Swiss, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. The updated rendition features 13 km of new taxiways, a vast construction zone around Terminal 5, custom jetways, performance-friendly optimization, custom VDGS, high-definition textures, and more. Itâs available on their website for roughly $26.30. Owners of the previous version are entitled to a 75% discount.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Columbia Metropolitan Airport (KCAE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Columbia, in South Carolina (United States), with a yearly average of 1.2 million passengers. It was built in 1940 as Lexington County Airport and was rapidly acquired by the US Army Air Corps for World War II usage, hosting the 105th Observation Squadron and its fleet of Douglas O-38s and North American O-47s.  A year later, it was totally under military control, and a program was started to fully convert it into a military airport, becoming the Columbia Army Air Base. The Air Base was primarily used for training, and some of the combat crew members participated in the famous Doolittle Raid in Japan. Training was eventually phased down by the end of the war, and it was rapidly returned to civilian control, becoming Columbia Metropolitan Airport. For a brief period, a bombardment squadron was assigned to the airport, but it left in 1949. A passenger terminal was built in the 1950s and eventually burned down, only to be replaced by a new one, which opened in 1965. It was expanded in the late 1980s, with an expanded terminal, a runway extension, and the construction of a new parking garage (which only reached completion in 2003). Renovation work was carried out in 1997, essentially replacing the old structure. Itâs a hub for UPS Airlines. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, and United Express serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made surfaces, highly detailed terminals, a fully modeled landside area, custom dynamic lighting, over 150 handcrafted models, and custom animated jetways. â Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $17.02, requiring at least 2.64 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimPixel has recently released their rendition of Naples International Airport (LIRN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the Metropolitan City of Naples, Campania region, with a yearly average of 12.6 million passengers, making it the fourth busiest airport in Italy. The airport started its life in the early 1900s as âCampo di Marteâ, a little airfield for general aviation, occasionally hosting flight exhibitions. World War 1 had the airport become a military airport to defend the town against the Austro-Hungarians and Germans. Then it saw heavy usage again during World War 2, this time by the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Air Force, and later became a major transshipment hub for cargo. The commercial debut occurred in 1950, marking the official opening of âNaples Airportâ. It serves as an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, Volotea, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Arabia, Air Cairo, Air Canada, Air France, American Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Finnair, flydubai, FlyOne, Iberia Express, Israir Airlines, ITA Airways, Jet2, KLM, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Swiss International Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Transavia, TUI, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution PBR textures, highly detailed terminals and hangars, dynamic night lighting, custom ground layout, static aircraft and ground equipment services, and performance-friendly optimization. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $22.34, requiring at least 5.71 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Dreamflight Studios has recently teased their rendition of Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport (KPVD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Providence, Rhode Island, with a yearly average of 4 million passengers.â It was dedicated in 1931 as Hillsgrove State Airport, and its first passenger terminal was built in 1933. Its original layout consisted of three 910-meter-long concrete runways. â It was used for flight training by the United States Army Air Force during 1942 and 1945, hosting the 435th Army Air Force Base. â The World War II occupation period led to several upgrades, including runway extensions (300 meters each) and slightly improved infrastructure. In the 1960s, a new terminal was constructed, as the old one was insufficient to handle a metropolitan area with over a million people.  â It wasnât until 1996 that it would see another upgrade, entirely replaced by a new passenger terminal with 18 gates. Four extra gates were added in 1997. â Itâs a hub for Wiggins Airways and an operating base for Breeze Airways. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, BermudAir, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Express serve it. â Thereâs no pricing information available yet, but it is expected to be released sometime this week.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has recently released their rendition of the Beechcraft B-390 Premier 1A for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a light business jet first conceived in the mid-1990s.Â  The Beechcraft B-390 Premier 1A was an updated version of the Premier 1, which was designed in the mid-90s, first flown in 1998, and certified in 2001. The IA was almost like a real-life patch to fix some lingering issues with the project, such as the subpar brakes, the noisy cabin, and the cockpit, which was deemed below par by many. The aforementioned upgrade rolled out in 2006, and over 163 new Premiers were built in five years. The little jet is powered by two Williams FJ44-2A Turbofan engines. It cruises at 841 km/h, has a range of 950 miles, a service ceiling of 41,000 feet, and, depending on the configuration, can carry 6 to 7 passengers. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $24.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Valve Software has recently announced their new hardware lineup for early 2026, including a Standalone Virtual Reality headset running Steam OS and capable of functioning as a PCVR headset via streaming.  Originally codenamed Valve Deckard, the Steam Frame is Valveâs first entry into the standalone headset market, following its pioneering role in mainstream PCVR headsets with the launch of the Valve Index in 2019, which is still widely used in 2025 and is considered one of the best headsets ever made. With 16 GB of unified LPDDR5X RAM, a 4nm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, UFS storage options ranging from 256 GB to 1 TB, dual LCD panels featuring a 2160x2160 resolution each, and pancake lenses, it rivals the best offerings from Meta and Pico.  Furthermore, the Steam Frame comes with its own 6 GHz dongle for PCVR streaming, and the addition of foveated streaming (possible thanks to the presence of eye tracking) will allegedly improve the streaming efficiency tenfold, as they can dynamically increase the pixels where your eyes are focusing on and lower the pixels where itâs not needed, making the image streaming as efficient as possible. â The controllers work on one AA battery each, and the analog sticks are magnetic, preventing the dreadful âstick driftâ, a known enemy to most virtual reality players.  As previously mentioned, the new headset will run on SteamOS, and Valve will implement a âSteam Frame Verifiedâ system (similar to what they did with the Steam Deck), allowing players to check whether the game they want to buy is compatible with their headset. Alternatively, streaming flat-screen titles from your PC will also be an option. â There is no release date or pricing information available yet, but Valve has mentioned that it will ship in early 2026.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently shared new previews from their upcoming Manchester International Airport (EGCC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, developed in cooperation with the airport authorities. Their next addition to the British lineup is nearing completion, built with extreme attention to detail using thousands of reference photos and textures. They also gained insight into their daily operations, future expansion plans, and design updates, which helped them further increase overall accuracy. Furthermore, they have also gained access to Terminal 2, which is still under construction, photographing every detail to ensure the scenery is as close to the real deal as possible. iniBuilds also thanked the community for their help, as it was a community-driven effort, with ramp staff, engineers, and even real-world pilots contributing as much as they could with reference imagery and feedback. The scenery will feature hand-made ground textures, a true-to-life landside recreation, dynamic airport lighting, custom jetways, over 180 hand-crafted models, a full HD ground poly, an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. â Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but iniBuilds says itâs âcoming soonâ and streamers will be getting their hands on it shortly.

    <title>MK Studios Releases Helsinki-Vantaa Airport V2 for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has recently released their updated rendition of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (EFHK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the Helsinki metropolitan area with a yearly average of 16.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in Finland. The airport was built in the early 1950s to replace Helsinkiâs former main airport, Malmi, which was considered too small and unable to handle the ever-increasing passenger figures.  For its first four years of existence, Helsinki-Vantaa was a single-runway airport. The second runway was only built in 1956, together with the first airplane hangar. Regular jet operations started three years later, in 1959. A new terminal opened in 1969, followed by the first transatlantic service to New York later in that same year. In 1993, an exclusively domestic terminal was built, and the international terminal was expanded and merged with the domestic terminal in 1996. Three years later, the international terminal underwent further expansion, accompanied by the creation of an arrival and departure lobby. Yet another runway was inaugurated in 2002, and the international terminal underwent its third expansion in 2004. In 2009, Terminal 2 was expanded with a total floor area of 43,908 square meters. Later that same year, the administration decided to remove the terminal-specific division between domestic and international flights, replacing it with a division based on airline. â In the early 2010s, the airportâs passenger figures skyrocketed, prompting further expansion work, which started shortly after. By 2012, a new terminal expansion had already been completed, and Terminal 1 and 2 were combined in 2022. Itâs a hub for Finnair, Norra, and Norwegian. Aegean Airlines, Air France, airBaltic, Eurowings, Icelandair, Japan Airlines, Juneyao Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Luxair, Pegasus Airlines, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Sunclass Airlines, SunExpress, TUI Airways, TUI fly Nordic, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality terminal models, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, real-world elevation data, and much more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $20.91, requiring at least 4.10 GB of free hard disk space to install. V1 owners get a 30% discount.

    <title>Nimbus Shares New Preview of Boeing 707 for X-Plane 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Nimbus Simulation Studios has released a new work-in-progress video, showcasing its upcoming Boeing 707 for X-Plane 12, with a focus on the JT3D powerplants. The footage highlights the characteristic fan roar and exhaust scream that defined early jet travel, giving a first taste of the audio experience the team is aiming for. According to Nimbus, the 707 is being built as a high-fidelity recreation of the classic three-crew jet. The aircraft features carefully modelled and textured visuals, with wing and engine vibrations, rattles and shakes, driven by physical forces, to provide visual cues about what is happening outside the cockpit.Â  Additional animations will depict the movement and complexity of mechanisms in the wings, tail, and landing gear. On the systems side, Nimbus plans to simulate all major systems, based on original manuals and available references. Meanwhile, the flight model is being tuned using performance charts and pilot testimonies to capture the hands-on feel of the era.Â  A virtual crew is also planned to assist with flow and system management, helping to reduce the workload for one simmer operating the aircraft alone. Nimbus has not yet announced a release date for the Boeing 707, but development updates will continue to be shared via its forum and Discord.

    <title>Dfflyer Releases Windsor International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-11-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Dfflyer - a new scenery developer in the scene - has just released their first scenery: a rendition of Windsor International Airport (CYQG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the Detroit-Windsor region with a yearly average of 330,000 passengers. It opened in 1928 as Walker Airport, after Hiram Walker, a Canadian whiskey distiller and distributor. It joined Canadaâs national portfolio of airports in 1967, when it was recognized for its regional importance as a hub for Southwestern Ontario.  Since early 2007, the airport has been managed by an ad hoc group on behalf of the City of Windsor. This arrangement followed the request by the last operator, Serco Services Inc., for early termination of their airport management contract in 2006, as the airport was losing 40k USD monthly. The new administration had a better fate, managing to post a small profit instead, and has since been granted an indefinite contract. Itâs served by Air Canada Express, Air Transat (to start in late 2025), Cameron Air Service, Porter Airlines, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom taxiway and runway lights, custom ground service equipment, custom cars, a high-quality rendition of the main terminal and all hangars, and more. Itâs available in their store for roughly $12.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
