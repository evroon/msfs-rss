    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has just released another Middle-eastern map for pre-ordering: Iraq. One of the most important parts of the world for air combat in the 20th and 21st centuries finally received its own map. It will cover more than 1,820,000kmÂ² Three versions of this map are available for purchase: Iraq, Iraq North and Iraq South.Â  The map division is the same as with the previous maps, such as Afghanistan. For example, if one buys Iraq North, they will receive the whole map, however, only the northern part of the map (the blue area in the picture) will be of higher detail. The same can be applied to to Iraq South map. The full version of the map will include more detailed areas of both the North and South(green and blue areas), while the rest will be of lower detail. The Iraq North map will cover more than 321,700kmÂ² of the detail area with 17 highly detailed airfields, some of them being: Baghdad Intlâ, Erbil Intlâ, Sulayimaniyah Intlâ, Kirkuk Intlâ, K1 Base, H2/3 Base, Mosul and other. It will cover mostly the territory of Iraq, with smaller parts of Iran and Syria.Â  Its counterpart, the Iraq South map on the other hand covers around 491,500kmÂ² of detailed area with 14 detailed airfields: Kuwait Intlâ, King Fahd Intlâ (Dammam), Bahrain Intlâ, Doha Intlâ, King Abdulaziz (air base near Dammam), Jubail Navalâ¦Â  Unfortunately, the Iraq South Map will not be available for pre-purchasing or early access. The pricing of the maps during the pre-purchase period (ending in Q4 2024) is as follows: After the pre-purchase period ends, the early access -20% discount will only apply to the Iraq map, as the Iraq North map EA price will be the same as the full release price. Eagle Dynamics has released a trailer for the upcoming map on their YouTube channel. If you have any more questions about the Afghanistan map, you may find your answers here. â The Early Access release is expected for Q4 2024, but as always Threshold will keep you updated with new info about the map! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <title>FlyByWire Simulations Releases Airbus A380 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fb380a"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/672403756f57fd8552c33ac1_a380-01.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlyByWire Simulations recently released their long-awaited rendition of the Airbus A380 for Microsoft Flight Simulator in an open alpha stage. It has enough operability for A to B flights, but many systems are still under development.Â  Their goal is to enable access to outside contributors and developers, provide the community with an early look, and actively work on further developing it over time with more features and tweaks. Due to the aircraft's sheer complexity and its current open alpha nature, performance is significantly more demanding than that of most payware aircraft. It requires at least an RTX 4080 Super for 1440p@60 at ultra and at least a GTX 1060 6 GB for 1080p at 30 fps on low settings. The current release (subject to change in the future as it is an early alpha) features a custom flight management system based on their updated fms-v2 implementation, with support for all ARINC424 leg types, holding support, and more. Furthermore, it accurately represents the primary flight display, navigation display, engine and warning display, and system display, with precise MEMOs for numerous systems and integrated checklists for normal and abnormal procedures. It also includes a comprehensive simulation of the core aircraft systems and 140 potential failures, although full simulation is not guaranteed at this development stage. Other features include realistic flight control surfaces, dynamic wing flex, Brake to Vacate capabilities, Runway Overrun Warning/Protection, and OANS (Onboard Airport Navigation System), which aids situational awareness by displaying a virtual airport map.Â  â Regarding future MSFS 2024 compatibility, FlyByWire has stated that it won't be available for the new platform as soon as it is out due to the significant amount of effort required due to differences in system requirements and 3D model optimizations, among other things. They will not be sticking to any specific timeline at the moment. â The A380X is available for free on the FlyByWire installer.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. KiwiFlightSim has recently released their rendition of Rarotonga International Airport (NCRG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Avarua in the Cook Islands, with a yearly average of 350,000 passengers. Built in 1944 by the United States Army Air Forces to support their Pacific campaign, establishing a vital link in the Allied supply chain by facilitating the transportation of troops and supplies to the frontlines, it marked a significant milestone in Rarotongaâs development, opening up the island to the outside world. The 5000-foot-long airstrip remained operational after the war, serving as a stopover point for trans-Pacific flights. It was not until the 1970s that it underwent a major overhaul to properly embrace the jet age and its steeper runway length and ground infrastructure requirements.Â  Twenty-one years ago, the terminal, departure, and check-in areas were heavily revamped to meet modern standards, and six years later, the terminal was reconstructed and expanded to accommodate the new passenger traffic demands. Itâs a hub for Air Rarotonga, and Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti, Hawaiian Airlines, and JetStar also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, custom ground markings, five detailed interiors, detailed surrounding buildings, custom night lighting, custom runway textures, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.29, requiring at least 1.82 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently issued a new update to their Boeing 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The update brings further stability fixes to the Universal Flight Tablet and fixes the broken pushback module from the previous build. The update is already available via the Operations Center for PMDG.com customers, whereas marketplace owners must wait until it goes through Microsoft's intake process. No changelog was provided with the update because of its tiny nature. They have also provided further information on their upcoming Boeing 777F for MSFS 2020 and 2024. As previously mentioned during their last development update, PMDG is unaware of how many changes will be required to function correctly in the new platform. As they waited for that to become clear, they sorted out issues related to the main deck cargo system and thoroughly tested items such as lighting and cargo door controls. It's said to be in great shape regarding operability, but they are taking their time to improve gameplay features they consider essential. In Randazzo's own words, streamers will receive their copy of the upcoming product "shortly." While part of their team works hard on the new triple seven variant, their 747 team is also hard at work on their new project, the Boeing 747-100 (and the -400). PMDG claims to have unprecedented access to a broad range of expertise, which will help make the 747 for MSFS their "lifetime project." They plan out on covering the entire 747 product line for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with the initial entries being the aforementioned 747-100 and the 747-400, but other variants such as the 747SP are also in the plans, and even some special projects like the RA001, Air Force One, and the original test-flight bird. â It is intended to be a love letter to the iconic aircraft, with an enormous amount of effort being put into making it happen. Below is a work-in-progress image of the overhead panel: Their product is available on PMDG.com and in the Marketplace, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TearWearDesigns recently released their rendition of Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (KXNA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. The airport serves Bentonville, Fayetteville, Springdale, and Rogers in Arkansas and has a yearly average of 1.9 million passengers. It opened in late 1998 to replace Fayetevilleâs Drake Field as the regionâs main airport, as the latter was deemed too small to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic demand. After nine years, the airport was expanded for the first time by constructing a new concourse, which increased the number of aircraft parking positions from twelve to twenty. In the 2010s, it was further expanded with an additional 4,700 square meters and twelve upper-level gates, which cost the administration around $21 million. A new concourse project was approved a few years ago. It will allow the airport to use the gates more efficiently and handle a higher passenger traffic volume. The cost estimate for the undertaking is around $35 million to $50 million. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, 3D vegetation, hand-placed night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.98, requiring at least 1.04 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds has released its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator (both 2020 and 2024), featuring Innsbruck Airport (LOWI). This airport, known for its challenging approach, serves the Austrian city of Innsbruck, which is nestled between the Alps. Each year, Innsbruck Airport welcomes over 900.000 passengers. The airport opened in 1925 with the goal of connecting the city to Munich by air. However, it soon became evident how challenging it was to land and take off in an airport surrounded by mountains. The airport played a significant role during the Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck in 1964 and 1976. Over the years, the airport has undergone various upgrades and improvements, enhancing both its capacity and safety for travelers. Today, it offers a range of both year-round and seasonal routes, supported by airlines such as Austrian Airlines, easyJet, and Eurowings, among others. Last year, the airport served 900.000 passengers. The new rendition of Innsbruck Airport features hand-crafted ground textures, an authentic airport landside, dynamic lighting, highly detailed airport buildings, an official GSX profile, and much more. The scenery requires a total of 5.41 GB of storage space and is available for $19.48 on the iniBuilds Store.Â  For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Showcases Upcoming Sharklets Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fnxsha"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/672ad36ef2cdccb6b9a18c44_sharklets12.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Fenix Simulations has published an in-depth development update showcasing the upcoming sharklets update for their A320 family lineup (except for the A319). As promised in the past, it is said to be released "this week" for all customers at no extra cost. While the A320 and the A321 will be getting the sharklets from the get-go this week, the A319 will take a while. Fenix Simulations claims it's been a bit tricky to obtain reliable data on it, as not many exist in real life.Â  The sharklets are more than just a visual thing. Airbus went the extra mile to warrant similar handling and overall behavior between both variants, mostly on the "software" side of things, making it hardly noticeable if one doesn't look closely enough. Fenix Simulations claims to have accurately replicated the subtle system differences and flight dynamics behavior, warranting a realistic experience. The flight model has been adjusted to the sharklets, with a bit more lift on the wings, less drag, and extra energy on flare, which is said to be subtle but noticeable if you pay close attention. Regardless, the fly-by-wire system should make the overall handling feel relatively homogeneous across all variants, as in real life. As previously mentioned, there are also software changes, with upgrades to the two elevator and aileron computers, three spoiler elevator computers, and the two flight augmentation computers, as well as less significant changes to the ECAM, fuel, FMGC, and more.Â  Among these ELAC changes, Fenix Simulations highlights the Load Alleviation Function, which alleviates wing structure loading, as the extra weight of the sharklets also means more strain on the wings, making them bend more aggressively in extreme conditions. The LAF system rapidly deploys ailerons upwards while in-flight or spoilers 4 and 5 to prevent that. The FBW system was also tweaked to accommodate the new system and its inherencies. Ground physics also underwent improvements. The tiller mapping from the real A320 was applied to their add-on, adding a bit of extra weight to the taxi phase across their entire range of aircraft (wingtips included). They have also built a custom wingflex model to accommodate the more obvious sharklet wingflex, taking into account a lot of factors such as localized forces, fuel tank level, etc. It has also been backported to the wingtip fences. They also reinforce that it's mostly a work in progress and might not be perfect initially. The ADIRS model has been upgraded to the newer version, applying to both aircraft. The old one has been ultimately retired as it's rare in currently flying A320s anymore. The ACP was also upgraded, and the old one was phased out. They plan on bringing both the old ADIRS and ACP as options in the future. The new digital standby instrument has also been added as an integral - and forced - part of the sharklets modernization, complete with the correct degraded displays and its functions. At long last, the ACT tanks were also added to the A321, allowing for realistically operated transcontinental flights and routes like Finnair's HELâPMI. The presence of the ACTs also means less space in the cargo compartment, which is also modeled. The lights were heavily tweaked to match the configuration of most A320SLs, featuring a full LED suite across the aircraft. Regarding liveries, they have painted 106 unique liveries so far, with accurate cockpit configurations, ACTs (A321 only, of course), and more. The expected rollout date is sometime this week, and the discount on the full bundle will end once that happens. They conclude with a statement on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: "Unfortunately, we were not permitted access to the DevAlpha (though we did ask Microsoft), which means we still don't have an answer for you on compatibility and timelines for adjusting to this new platform. Our intent will be to bring compatibility and stability first and foremost, then at a later time assess the new feature set and see what makes sense." Therefore, they found themselves unable to make any promises regarding dates, viability, or anything for that matter. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airfoillabs has recently announced the development of a high-fidelity Boeing 737 Max for X-Plane, featuring realistic flight dynamics, a detailed 3D cockpit environment, cockpit builder friendliness, and more. The development process will be completely transparent, with the developers providing frequent development updates on their X-Plane Org forum thread delineating every step taken into building the add-on. The updates will occur every month with detailed progress reports, media (screenshots and videos), technical deep dives, and clear milestone tracking with real-time progress indicators. They have already come up with an expected feature list for each release: alpha, beta, 1.0, and the future beyond that. The alpha release will implement the core flight dynamics, a detailed 3D cockpit environment, basic systems, and a relatively basic flight model. The beta release, on the other hand, should bring comprehensive aircraft systems, advanced autopilot functionality, initial FMS implementation, and the integration of the core systems. For 1.0, the aircraft should fully integrate all its systems, Â a custom EFB, a professional-grade sound environment, and complete documentation and manuals. â The aircraft should get regular updates based on community feedback, enhanced functionality releases, ongoing systems refinement, and advanced feature implementations post-release. â What they claim sets their 737 Max apart is that it's explicitly built for X-Plane's flight model engine, with a deep systems simulation focused on professional-grade accuracy. Thus, it's a potential platform for cockpit-building enthusiasts. â The development updates will start next Friday, with an in-depth look at their cockpit modeling progress. In the coming weeks, a real-time development tracker will be added to their website, where potential customers will be able to see its current development state. â Refer to their announcement post for further information on the matter.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. NZA Simulations has recently released their rendition of Wanaka Airport (NZWF) and its surroundings for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring over 5000 square kilometers of enhanced terrain, nine airports, and more. Wanaka Airport serves the town of Wanaka, in Otago, New Zealand, with a passenger average circling around the 5 digit mark (exact numbers are not available).Â  It was built in 1984 on top of a pre-existing private airstrip owned by Tim Wallis, a Kiwi businessman and aviation entrepreneur, ultimately replacing Mount Iron Aerodrome, which used to be Wanakaâs only airport and deemed too small for their plans back then. Air New Zealand started scheduled services in 2004, canceling them after only nine years due to low demand (which would only peak during airshow weekends). Local businesses rapidly stepped in to fill the gap, albeit unsuccessfully.Â  â In late 2020, SoundsAir started a scheduled service route to Christchurch airport, which is currently the airportâs only commercial traffic.Â  Other than the airport itself, the package also offers a 5000 square kilometer coverage around its surroundings, with nine airports in total, four helipads, 20+ mountain huts, 3D models, PBR texturing, high-resolution aerial imagery, 3D interiors for the main airport, Skydive Wanaka Hangar &amp; Customer area, Whare Kea Chalet Hut, Aspiring Helicopters, and Makarora Hangars. Below is a map with all the airports, airstrips, and landmarks included: Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $21.72, requiring at least 4.19 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Fenix Simulations Releases Sharklets Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Fenix Simulations has recently released the long-awaited sharklets update for their Airbus family lineup (except for the A319) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, at no extra cost and with a wealth of new features. While the A320 and the A321 will be getting the sharklets as of right now, the A319 will take a while. They claim it's been a bit tricky to obtain reliable data on it, as not many exist in real life.Â  The sharklets are more than just a visual thing. Airbus went the extra mile to warrant similar handling and overall behavior between both variants, mainly on the "software" side of things, making it hardly noticeable if one doesn't look closely enough. Fenix Simulations claims to have accurately replicated the subtle system differences and flight dynamics behavior, warranting a realistic experience. The flight model has been adjusted to the sharklets, with a bit more lift on the wings, less drag, and extra energy on flare, which is said to be subtle but noticeable if you pay close attention. Regardless, the fly-by-wire system should make the overall handling feel relatively homogeneous across all variants, as in real life. As previously mentioned, there are also software changes, with upgrades to the two elevator and aileron computers, three spoiler elevator computers, and the two flight augmentation computers, as well as less significant changes to the ECAM, fuel, FMGC, and more.Â  Among these ELAC changes, Fenix Simulations highlights the Load Alleviation Function, which alleviates wing structure loading, as the extra weight of the sharklets also means more strain on the wings, making them bend more aggressively in extreme conditions. The LAF system rapidly deploys ailerons upwards while in-flight or spoilers 4 and 5 to prevent that. The FBW system was also tweaked to accommodate the new system and its inherencies. Ground physics also underwent improvements. The tiller mapping from the real A320 was applied to their add-on, adding a bit of extra weight to the taxi phase across their entire range of aircraft (wingtips included). They have also built a custom wingflex model to accommodate the more obvious sharklet wingflex, taking into account a lot of factors such as localized forces, fuel tank level, etc. It has also been backported to the wingtip fences. They also reinforce that it's mostly a work in progress and might not be perfect initially. The ADIRS model has been upgraded to the newer version, applying to both aircraft. The old one has been ultimately retired as it's rare in currently flying A320s anymore. The ACP was also upgraded, and the old one was phased out. They plan on bringing both the old ADIRS and ACP as options in the future. The new digital standby instrument has also been added as an integral - and forced - part of the sharklets modernization, complete with the correct degraded displays and its functions. Lastly, the ACT tanks were added to the A321, allowing for realistically operated transcontinental flights and routes like Finnair's HELâPMI. The presence of the ACTs also means less space in the cargo compartment, which is also modeled. The complete changelog follows down below: Avionics and Systems The update is available right now via Fenix Installer. The full bundle (A319/A320/A321) is available on their website for roughly $103.87. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
