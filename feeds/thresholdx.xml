    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Taimodels recently released their rendition of Cairo International Airport (HECA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It's the largest and busiest airport in Egypt, with a yearly average of 14 million passengers.Â  It was built as John Payne Field Air Force Base during World War 2, a major Air Transport Command air cargo and passenger hub for the allied forces.Â  After the end of the war, the Civil Aviation Authority took over, using it for international civil aviation and ultimately replacing the old Heliopolis Airport in 1963. The first passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1963 by President Gamal Abdel Nasser. It was expanded over the following decades, with the construction of a second hall in the late 1970s and a third one in 1980.Â  Renovation work was carried out in the early 2000s to bring the airport up to modern standards and expand the departure hall. Terminal 2 was inaugurated in 1986, with seven boarding gates serving european, gulf, and east asian airlines. It closed in 2010 for renovation work, which took two years to complete. The newest terminal, Terminal 3, opened in 2004 after the administration realized the current structure wouldn't match the projected growth and neither of the terminals could be expanded any further. Twice as large as both terminals combined, it can handle 11 million passengers a year. It's a hub for EgyptAir, Nile Air, Air Cairo, and Air Arabia Egypt. Aegean Airlines, Aeroflot, Air Arabia, Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, ITA Airways, Kuwait Airways, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made PBR texturing, realistic lighting, custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, and custom jetways. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $23.24, requiring at least 1.60 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Verticalsim Releases Huntington Tri-State Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/668efe0fd8cc74fed320d854_hunt1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released its rendition of Huntington Tri-State Airport (KHTS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Huntington, West Virginia, Ashland, Kentucky, and Ironton, Ohio, with a yearly average of 198,000 passengers. The seeds of the airport were sown in 1922 when the Huntington Chamber of Commerce formed an aviation committee tasked with finding a suitable location for an airfield. Recognizing the potential of air travel, the community rallied behind the initiative. Decades later, in 1952, Tri-State Airport was finally dedicated after years of planning and construction. In the early years, propeller planes like the Piedmont DC-3s arrived, followed by Eastern and Allegheny Airlines in 1953. As passenger demand grew, so did the airport. The runway was extended in 1956 to accommodate larger aircraft. This expansion paved the way for the introduction of jetliners, with Piedmont operating the first 737s in 1969. The present terminal building, a testament to the airport's commitment to modernization, was constructed between 1959 and 1961âfurther runway expansions followed in 1973, solidifying Tri-State's position as a vital regional transportation hub. Allegiant Air (Fort Walton Beach, Orlando/Sanford, Punta Gorda, FL, St. Petersburg) and American Eagle (Charlotte) serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom terraforming, performance-friendly optimization, high-resolution PBR texturing, custom aerial imagery, an up-to-date ground layout, and basic interiors for optimal performance. It's available on Contrail for roughly $12.59, requiring at least 1.56 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!  â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. MXI Design recently released its version of Ãrebro Airport (ESOE) for X-Plane 12. Located just over 6 miles from the city of Ãrebro, the airport is the 23rd largest airport in Sweden in terms of passengers. It serves around 80,000 passengers yearly and is also involved in various cargo operations. Ãrebro Airport opened in 1978 after discussions about a new airport in the region were ongoing in the early 50s and 60s. The airport initially had a 1,300-meter-long runway, which has now been extended to 3,300 meters. In the 1990s, the airport started to focus on cargo operations in addition to passenger transport. In terms of regional freight, Ãrebro Airport is the largest in all of Sweden. The airport is currently used by several airlines, including Ryanair, Sunclass Airlines, and ASL Airlines France, for both passenger and cargo operations. The scenery package includes an accurate and highly detailed rendition of the airport, an up-to-date ground layout, basic interior, PBR implementation, animated flags, 3D passengers, custom aerial imagery, and more. The newly released Ãrebro Airport requires 2.14 GB of storage space, and it is available on both SimMarket and Orbx for approximately $13.10. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Updates 777-300ER for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777037"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66904e3dbe652ec8847e6d37_ana1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued a new update to their newly released Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing a few more fixes to the WASM issues, sound tweaks, and news on future updates for the DC-6 and 737s.Â  In an unusual fashion, the forum post begins with a paragraph on a future DC-6 update, which will improve texture clarity on gauges and dials and many of the placards and indicators throughout the flight deck. The update stems from what they have learned with the 737 and 777, which were initially applied on an experimental basis but were deemed too good to be kept private. The following bit details an SU15-induced issue that led to the aircraft freezing entirely, although the simulator would keep running. They claim it has to do with changes in how the platform handles C++ code issues that otherwise wouldnât cause crashes. PMDG has been working hard to find and mitigate the triggers to provide maximum stability.Â  Said fixes are being rolled out gradually on the 777 and will also be rolled out to the 737 in due time. A beta version has been pushed out to their testers so they can ensure itâs working fine before a full rollout. PMDG is confident that update 2.00.0037 will give the 777 stability and protection against the SU15 issues that were unmasked with the help of their testers and customers. They have found most of the root causes and dealt with them accordingly.Â  With that being said, their âguard is still up,â and bug reports are still being constantly evaluated, with more fixes on the way.Â  The next update is already being worked on, and itâs anticipated to include a fix for the long filenames problem and a potential new feature: Navigraph data might be updated through the Ultimate Flight Tablet. Other fixes are also pending. The changelog for todayâs update follows below: â The 777-300ER is available on PMDG.com for $77.73.

    <title>Parallel 42 Releases 777 Immersion Pack for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777ime"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel 42 recently released their 777 Immersion package for Microsoft Flight Simulatorâpart of their SimFX add-onâaiming to improve the overall realism of the effects for the PMDG 777 (and CaptainSim, eventually) with condensation, realistic chemtrails, brake smoke, and more. Available as a single package for all major renditions of the triple seven airframe regardless of the livery used, bringing immersive effects for the PMDG and CaptainSim (at a later date) and customized for each with performance as their top priority.Â  Built on the SimFx framework, it offers the best combination of effects and customizability via the SimFx interface. For the unaware, Parallel 42âs SimFX is a visual effects utility covering a range of immersive scenarios. Environmental variables and formulas authentically govern every particle on the screen, and dynamic effects appear under the right conditions, creating unique moments in the virtual skies. The effects include contrails, heat blurs, wing wash, rotor wash, and more. Their immersion package for the 777 builds on top of what SimFx already offers, bringing nineteen custom effects for the mighty triple seven, including swirling contrails, condensation effects, waste water drain every hour, engine cold start effects, fuel jettison, cloud illumination, hot brakes smoke, carbon brake dust, and water droplets. The APU heat blur and the St. Elmoâs fire are not supported because of a development choice by PMDG, using a deprecated technique preventing SimFX or 777 Immersion from injecting their version of those effects. The package is available on Contrail for roughly $15.00, requiring at least 2 MB of free hard disk space to install. Bear in mind that the 777 Package requires SimFX to work.
