    <title>Parallel 42 Publishes Introduction to ChasePlane for MSFS 2020</title>
    <updated>2025-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 has recently published a blog article providing more information on their recently announced ChasePlane plugin for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, covering its features, MSFS 2024 compatibility info, and lots of in-game footage. They start by mentioning that their teaser was only teasing the cinematics system, which is one of the possibilities offered by their new product: switching effortlessly between cockpit view, external angles, and even airport cameras if you so desire. Custom presets can be easily created and shared online with seamless bind controls. â For the unfamiliar, ChasePlane was originally released in 2016 for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, later being made compatible with Prepar3d and rapidly becoming the de facto camera application for ESP-based simulators at the time. It would only be natural for them to develop it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 when that came about, but technical limitations have made that impossible until very recently, which is why itâs only a thing now, almost five years after the simulatorâs release.Â  â ChasePlane will initially be released for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 only, but they do have Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in mind and already have a working build, albeit unstable due to the simulatorâs very early nature. That makes it hard for them to commit to a public release, as an update could break everything. âWe canât afford to waste time chasing a moving target,â concluded Edson Soriano, Parallel 42âs Managing Director. Due to platform limitations, ChasePlane will not be compatible with Xbox.Â  â The add-on will feature a highly realistic physics-based camera behavior based on extensive research and real-world pilot footage, warranting realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, embracing the flight model rather than altering it. Pilots can feel the vibration during the take-off roll, the rush of turbulence, and the fluid shifts during maneuvers. They have embedded videos demonstrating the camera system on the ârealisticâ preset with different aircraft and conditions. Users can adjust the settings regarding intensities, etc., with sliders. The complete feature list for the product follows below: â They have not yet been able to provide information on a potential release date or pricing, but itâs said to be coming soon.  â Parallel 42 is ensuring the software is stable through extensive beta testing, ensuring itâs launched in a relatively solid state, thus creating a smooth sailing experience for the customers. They are currently working on refining the user interface, polishing features, and ensuring overall smoothness on a wide range of hardware.

    <title>Just Flight Announces V2 Update for Hawk T1/A</title>
    <updated>2025-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67a0e6befa9df6d7d57b7c1a_image1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has announced a significant update, version 2, for its Hawk T1/A advanced trainer. This update introduces a variety of changes, the most notable being the addition of MSFS 2024 support. â New and improved flight model According to Just Flight, the original flight model was no longer working as well as it used to, prompting the team to completely redesign it from the ground up. The team emphasises that the Hawk still must be flown in a realistic manner, just as it was before. New weapons functionality You can now fire Sidewinder missiles, drop practice bombs, and jettison payloads. The static weapons are also included in the PC and Xbox Marketplace versions, though they won't have animation. â New liveries The following liveries have been added to the Hawk T1/A Advanced Trainer: Green smoke is now available with the Saudi Falcons livery. There are limits on the amount of smoke that can be produced per flight, just as in real life. Options to refill or enable unlimited smoke are also included. âEFB improvements âVersion 3 of Just Flightâs EFB now includes a redesigned interface and features such as Navigraph enroute charts. â âMSFS 2024 compatibility âJust Flight states that the aircraft will be available from third-party retailers as well as through the MSFS 2020 marketplace. It will also be offered in the MSFS 2024 marketplace once that becomes available. Current owners can download the updated aircraft for free from the Just Flight website, with the update soon to be available from third parties. â Stay tuned to Threshold for news, reviews, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Astralis Studios has recently showcased their upcoming Region of Waterloo International Airport (CYKF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This airport serves Kitchener-Waterloo and surrounding areas seeing 118,541 aircraft movements in 2018. The airport was opened in 1930 and was used mainly for flight instruction. At the end of World War 2 there was a push for a larger and more appropriate place for private and commercial aviation in the area. In 1948, the Waterloo-Wellington Airport Commission acquired a larger site in the Breslau area and a new airfield was completed there in 1950. The then K-W Municipal Airport became a general aviation facility in 1969. Today, it is served by airlines such as WestJet, Sunwing, and Flair Airlines. Non-stop commercial flights from Waterloo include destinations such as Calgary, Vancouver, Cancun, Halifax and more. In addition to commercial traffic, the airport is a popular general aviation hub and is home to the second largest flight training centre in Canada, Waterloo Wellington Flight Centre, as well as a plethora of privately owned hangars. This scenery includes over 60 custom objects, custom ground markings, enhanced night lighting as well as PBR texturing. It will be released on February 6th and will be available for $15.99 on all platforms. â Stay tuned to Threshold for all of your flight simulation news!</summary>

    <title>FlyDesign Releases Krakow-Balice Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/kra024"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67a1d90118932095932e524d_kra1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlyDesign has recently released their rendition of John Paul International Krakow-Balice Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving KrakÃ³w, Poland, with a yearly average of 11 million passengers.Â  Its construction started in 1964, opening for civil aviation three years later, in 1967. A passenger terminal was only built four years after its civil opening. The 1970s brought further development work to accommodate larger aircraft: a longer runway, new taxiways, and high-intensity runway lights. A new terminal was inaugurated in the late 1980s after the authorities deemed the actual capacity to be subpar compared to the projected traffic figures for the upcoming decade. Thus, it was inaugurated in 1993, followed by apron upgrades in 1995. New modernization work was carried out in 2002, focusing on improving the international passenger experience. Such effort was not in vain, and international routes increased in the following years. A separate domestic terminal (Terminal 2) was opened in 2007, and at the time, plans were underway to build an entirely new terminal in addition to Terminal 2. Ryanair opened their second Polish base in KrakÃ³w in 2012, basing two 737-800 aircraft there and connecting KrakÃ³w to many destinations across Europe.Â  Krakow-Balice became the first regional airport in Poland to reach over 9 million passengers yearly in 2023.Â  â â Due to the recent increase in traffic, the authorities have announced an upgrade plan to build a new terminal. The current terminal is not large enough to meet the projected demand for the future. â Itâs a focus city for Buzz Air (Ryanair Poland), Wizz Air, and LOT Polish Airlines. Aegean Airlines, airBaltic, Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ground textures, hand-placed vegetation, fully dynamic lighting, high-definition buildings, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $22.00, requiring at least 924.68 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>SiamFlight Releases Phuket International Airport for MSFS 2020</title>
    <updated>2025-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/sflphu"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SiamFlight recently released their rendition of Phuket International Airport (VTSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves the island of Phuket, Thailand, and has a yearly average of 17.2 million passengers, making it the third busiest airport in Thailand. Built in 1988 to accommodate only 6.5 million passengers yearly, it operated nearly at capacity for almost 30 years, until a new expansion project brought the figures to 20 million passengers per year (12.5 million passengers on the new terminal, 6.5 on the old one). It currently has three terminals: Terminal 2 handles international flights, Terminal 3 handles domestic operations, and Terminal X exclusively handles charters. Due to space constraints, Phuket has reached its capacity limit, which led the authorities to consider a rail link to Krabi International Airport for traffic alleviation in the near â or distant â future. In addition to the link, thereâs a plan to build an entirely new airport elsewhere to serve Phang Nga, Phuket, and Krabi. It was supposed to be a multi-phase project, with phase one to start in 2022 and reach completion by 2025, but everything was indefinitely put on hold.Â  Itâs a focus city for Thai Airways International and an operating base for Bangkok Airways, Thai Lion Air, and Thai AirAsia. Aeroflot, Air Arabia,Â  Air China, Air India, Azur Air, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Condor, Emirates, HK Express, IndiGo, Jetstar, Korean Air, Mahan Air, Nok Air, Qatar Airways, Scoot, Singapore Airlines, TUI, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terminals with an interior, custom ground textures, custom jetways, landside buildings, hand-placed taxiway guidance signs, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $21.38, requiring at least 196.68 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has released Emerald Airport (YEML), developed by Rob Byrne, for MSFS 2020 and 2024. Emerald Airport is situated in the Central Highlands region of Queensland, Australia, approximately 6 km south of Emerald, the main town it serves. QantasLink, Virgin Australia Regional, and Alliance Airlines operate an average of 54 return flights to Brisbane every week. The area is sparsely populated, with fewer than two inhabitants per square kilometre. Additionally, it experiences very little rainfall, averaging around 830 millimetres of precipitation per year. Orbx says Emerald Airport for MSFS offers detailed exteriors and interiors of its terminals. The airport features subtle terraforming, with night lighting for both the terminal and aprons, as well as custom ground markings. There is also custom lighting on the runway, taxiway, and aprons. â In addition, the airport includes a detailed helicopter hangar, general aviation hangars, fuel facilities, and functioning anemometers that respond to changes in wind speed. â A full feature list follows: The scenery can be purchased for $16.36 at the Orbx store and is compatible with both MSFS 2020 and 2024. â Stay tuned to Threshold for news, reviews, and more.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PhotoRico has recently released their rendition of Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024. The airport serves the municipality of San Juan in Puerto Rico and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers. Constructed by the US Navy in 1929 as Naval Station Isla Grande, it served as Puerto Ricoâs main international gateway until 1954, when it was ultimately replaced by Isla Verde International Airport. All international airlines moved there shortly after. The airportâs future was questioned a few times in the early 2000s, but a definitiveâfavorableâdecision was eventually reached in 2006 due to its key function as a primary reliever for Puerto Ricoâs main airport. In early 2011, the airportâs future went through another scare: the FAA wanted to close the airportâs control tower because they operated it themselves and intended to cut costs. Air Flamenco, Fly the Whale, M&amp;N Aviation, and Vieques Air Link regularly serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail buildings, custom ground textures, detailed landside, real static GA aircraft, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.70, requiring at least 873.59 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The jury, selected from members of the Threshold, cruiselevel, and FSElite teams have reviewed all product releases from 2024.  After careful deliberation, the nominees have been narrowed down to a select few finalists in each category. In MSFS and X-Plane, there are three categories: airliners, aircraft and scenery. Additionally, the best add-on for DCS has its own category, along with the best tools, hardware, and freeware for the entire flight sim genre. To conclude, there is a special Content Creator category where you, along with thousands of other fans, determine the winner! â Members of the jury are not the only ones who have a say in the decision. Starting this Friday, February 14, you can vote for your favourites! The final result will be determined by a 50/50 split between the jury and the public votes. Categories will be scored using a point system. Award five points to your favourite, four points to your second favourite, three points to your third favourite, and so on for your top five. Juries will follow the same scoring system. The entry with the most combined points at the end will be declared the winner! â The flight simulation community has no shortage of great content creators. The Flight Sim Awards aim to recognize your favourites, and this category will truly showcase who your top choice is, as 100 percent of the points are determined by the public. â The 2025 Flight Sim Awards will take place on Friday, March 14, the eve before FSWeekend in Lelystad at the Captain's Dinner.

    <title>Orbx Releases Sandane Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently released their rendition of Sandane Airport (ENSD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the village of Sandane in Norway and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers.Â  The airport was built in the early 1970s and opened in 1975, then the only airport serving the district of Nordfjord. Due to its geography and low regularity, its initial years were plagued by severe turbulence, which was eventually partially mitigated in the following decades by a terminal expansion and a runway extension. The regularity issue was addressed relatively recently by installing navigation systems, ultimately reducing the canceled flights to a mere 5% in 2022. Its pre-ILS days were rather grim, with airplanes often dealing with low visibility, extreme winds, and insufficient runway. Itâs served by WiderÃ¸e, which has obligatory public service flights to Bergen, Oslo, and Sogndal, flown with Dash 8-100 airplanes. The Norwegian government subsidizes all of the routes. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 2K PBR textures, custom ground decals, crisp orthoimagery, custom approach lighting and ground equipment, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $11.97, requiring at least 842.51 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Salvuz Releases Bergen Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Salvuz recently released their rendition of Bergen Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It is the second busiest airport in Norway, with a yearly average of 6 million passengers. Dating back to the early 1950s, Bergen Airport was partially funded by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana with 4 million Norwegian kroner, securing the construction of a terminal and a 1,460-meter-long runway. NATO funded an expansion in 1953, warranting a 2,440-meter-long runway instead. When the first flight landed at the airport in mid-1954, only 800 meters were complete. It was a chartered flight from Bergen to Oslo, transporting a local football team. Itâs a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e, with an extensive domestic and intra-European network. According to 2014 data, Scandinavian Airlines had 46% of the market share for domestic flights, Norwegian had 38%, and WiderÃ¸e 15%. Internationally, Norway led the way with 36%, SAS with 23%, and KLM with 18% (with a single route to Amsterdam).Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed buildings, high-resolution PBR textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date layout (as of 2024), and it also supports MSFS 24âs new lighting and LOD system. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.85, requiring at least 1.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.
