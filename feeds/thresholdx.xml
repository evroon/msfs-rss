    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 recently published a video on their YouTube channel showcasing ChasePlaneâs onboarding tutorial. The video walks you through setting up all the necessary items to get the best experience and provides further information on the optional community access. The 10-minute video covers the entirety of the introductory steps, walking you through removing your bindings in Microsoft Flight Simulator (ChasePlane âkidnapsâ the camera system), configuring your bindings, setting up different camera presets, enabling cinematics, and sharing views with the community. â Itâs important to note thatâunlike Flow, one of their best-selling products for MSFSâcloud storage canât be provided for free, as it takes significantly more space. Therefore, they have chosen to make the cost optional, lowering the productâs final price tag and allowing customers to decide whether they want to pay extra for community access. The prices for community access range from 5 dollars for the yearly subscription to 20 dollars for a lifetime.Â  â P42 also reiterates that community access is NOT needed to share camera views, as they have built powerful importing and exporting methods that allow you to share camera views via any platform outside of their community ecosystem. â Refer to this blog post for further information on the optional community access system.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 has just released its latest Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 scenery. This time, the team has focused on the City of Derry Airport (EGAE) in Derry, Northern Ireland. The airport serves approximately 150,000 passengers each year. The airfield opened in 1941 as a Royal Air Force base and was used for military purposes until the 1950s. After that, the airport saw limited usage, with Emerald Airways operating a route to Glasgow. The airline constructed a new terminal building and control tower for the airport, with the first Glasgow flights commencing in 1967.Â  â A little over a decade later, Loganair began offering a few routes from the airport. Over the years, the airport has undergone various extensions and upgrades as it continued to grow and new airlines started to operate there.Â  â Today, airlines such as easyJet, Loganair, Ryanair, and Volotea serve the airport, providing destinations like Edinburgh, London, Manchester, and more. As a result, the airport handles approximately 7,000 aircraft movements and welcomes around 150,000 passengers annually. The scenery includes features like detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, night effects, highly detailed airport vehicles, vegetation, PBR materials, and static GA aircraft. The newly released City of Derry Airport is now available on SimMarket for approximately $15.69. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>TDS Sim Software Releases GTNXi for X-Plane</title>
    <updated>2025-02-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tdsxpl"/>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TDS Sim Software has recently released GTNXi for X-Plane 11 and 12. The GTNXi is a rendition of the Garmin 650Xi and 750Xi navigation with support for both Navigraph charts and data. Like its real-life counterpart, the GTNXi provides the pilot with various features, such as full autopilot control laterally and vertically (including support for LPV approaches), 8.33kHz COM frequency spacing, the ability to fly RF legs, a Glide Range Ring, a Smart Glide, and a Nearest Airport Indication Arrow. It also supports dual GPS/Flight plans, per-device CDI, mouse wheel zoom-in/out of the map page, full VC integration and a 2D pop-up available concurrently, worldwide live METAR, SmartGlide, and much more. The full list is rather lengthy, but it can be found in the .pdf manual included with the addon. The TDS GTNXi comes with VC integration support for X-Plane 12 for the following add-ons: If your favourite general aviation plane isnât on the list, don't worry! The GTNXi comes with Legacy VC Integration, which can detect and install the TDS add-on into all add-on aircraft that provide a legacy GTN 3D bezel unit. According to the developers, this will be useful for users with X-Plane 11 aircraft, as those will not come with TDS GTNXi VC Integration standards. More information about this can also be found in the .pdf manual. If the aircraft doesnât have VC-integrated GPS support, you can always use it as a 2D pop-up. The TDS Sim Softwareâs GTNXi can be purchased here for roughly $ 68.20. It requires X-Plane 11/12, Windows 10 (version 1909) or Windows 11, Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500, at least 16GB of RAM memory, Nvidia RTX2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT, with at least 4GB of video card memory, and at least 6GB of free space on hard disk. Navigraph subscription is also required for database updates and charts. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. DominicDesignTeam recently released their new rendition of Indianapolis International Airport (KIND)Â for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Indianapolis with a yearly average of 4.7 million passengers, making it the busiest in Indiana and the 43rd busiest in the United States. It opened in 1931 to replace Stout Field, which used to be the cityâs main airport at the time.Â  Indianapolis was one of the main transcontinental flights and rail service stops between Los Angeles and New York City. It was started by Trans World Airlinesâ precursor, Transcontinental Air Transport. Its original terminal used to be on the east side of the airfield, now demolished (1957-2008). It was replaced by a new terminal in late 2008, with 110,000 square meters of built area between parallel runways.Â  Itâs a hub for FedEx Express and an operating base for Allegiant Air and Republic Airways. Aer Lingus (to begin in May), Air Canada Express, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines,.and United Express. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, dynamic lighting, custom ground markings, custom jetway, custom animations, performance-friendly optimization, and more.

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Releases KrakÃ³w John Paul II International Airport V2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their new rendition of KrakÃ³w John Paul II International Airport v2 (EPKK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the city of KrakÃ³w, Poland, and has a yearly average of 11 million passengers, making it the second busiest airport in Poland. Its construction began in 1964, with its eventual opening for civil aviation three years later, in 1967.Â  During its first four years of operation, KrakÃ³w Airport didnât have a passenger terminal, which was only built in 1971. The 1970s also brought a runway extension, new taxiways, and the installation of high-intensity runway lights. In the late 1980s, the administration decided to build a new terminal, which opened in 1993. Shortly after, in 1995, an apron modernization followed. Further modernization was carried on in 2002 to ensure readiness for more international operations. A brand new terminal was constructed between 2013 and 2016 to ensure it could handle the extra traffic brought by Ryanairâs second Polish base, which opened in 2012. Two years ago, KrakÃ³w became Polandâs first regional airport to pass the 9 million passenger threshold. Such impressive traffic figures and eventual projected growth led to plans for a new terminal to better accommodate the extra influx.Â  The scenery features a high-quality rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, custom night lighting, a high-definition terrain mesh, performance-friendly interior modeling, an up-to-date ground layout, static aircraft, custom ground service equipment, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.88, requiring at least 1.52 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 recently made a blog post announcing their decision to stop charging an extra fee for cloud storageÂ and offerÂ the full experience in a singleÂ lifetimeÂ package. The community did not take too well to their original idea of charging extra for cloud storage due to how much it would cost Parallel 42 to keep the structure running. The options ranged from 5 dollars for a yearly subscription to 20 dollars for lifetime access.Â  â Even though community access was not required to share camera presets, as ChasePlane also features a powerful importer/exporter tool that allows people to simply share the files over on Discord or any file hoster, the backlash was immense due to how negatively the subscription system is generally viewed by simmers and gamers alike.Â  â With that in mind, Parallel 42 has decided to include the access with the base package without any extra charges. They will commit to the ever-growing expenses of running such cloud infrastructure while meeting their original price target.Â  â Such a decision was not made haphazardly; they conducted a very deep cost analysis to ensure it wouldnât eventually backfire.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently made a statement in their Discord server, shedding light on some lingering questions about their upcoming A350 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. These questions mostly concern the lack of stability observed on showcase live streams, performance information, and a release date confirmation. They begin with vague information on how the aircraft performs, stating it will differ depending on hardware, but it should be within the same ballpark or marginally better than the Fenix A320. To further aid performance, they will also offer low-resolution texture options and no cabin option (MSFS 2024 only, as 2020 doesnât have a cabin to begin with).Â  In addition to their own navigation data, iniBuilds will also include Navigraphâs WASM to ensure maximum stability. Following the showcase streams and feedback, they have already addressed a multitude of items, including the checklist crash, the WASM crash at Atlanta International Airport, overall stability improvements, sound improvements, and art tweaks. The complete changelog follows below: Systems: Sounds:  Art: âSome gear wire clipping and animation issues resolved â iniBuilds also emphasizes the importance of running Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 SU 1 Beta to warrant the best experience possible with the 2024 version of their upcoming A350, especially if you use Navigraph. Non-Navigraph users donât have to be on the latest beta, but itâs still advised nonetheless.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SiamFlight recently released their rendition of Tachileik Airport (VYTL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which serves the homonymous town of Tachileik in Myanmar. Established in the late 1940s, when Myanmar was undergoing significant changes following its independence from British colonial rule, it initially only featured basic infrastructure, with a very modest airstrip whose only goal was to facilitate transportation in the mountainous region, which was largely underdeveloped at the time. Its strategic location near the Thai border historically transformed Tachileik into a gateway for trade and cultural exchange between Myanmar and Thailand. During a good part of the 20th century, when Myanmar's economy became increasingly isolated due to political instability and international sanctions, Tachileik became a key hub for informal cross-border trade in textile, electronics, and agricultural products. In the 1980s and 1990s, as Myanmar began to open up its economy cautiously, Tachileik Airport saw gradual improvements in its infrastructure. The government recognized the potential of the airport to boost tourism and regional trade, particularly with Thailand. During this period, the airport was upgraded to accommodate larger aircraft, and regular flights from Yangon and Mandalay were introduced. This development was part of a broader effort by the Myanmar government to promote tourism in the Shan State, which is known for its scenic landscapes, ethnic diversity, and cultural heritage. Despite its successes, Tachileik Airport has faced numerous challenges over the years. The region's remote location and underdeveloped infrastructure have often hindered its growth. Moreover, political instability and ethnic conflicts in Shan State have occasionally disrupted airport operations and deterred tourists. However, in recent years, the Myanmar government has tried to modernize the airport and improve its facilities. Upgrades to the runway, terminal building, and navigation systems have enhanced safety and accommodated larger aircraft. Looking to the future, Tachileik Airport is poised to play an even more significant role in the region's development. Plans for further upgrades and expansion are underway to transform the airport into a major regional hub. The ongoing development of the East-West Economic Corridor, a key initiative under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program, is expected to enhance Tachileik's connectivity and economic potential. As Myanmar continues integrating into the regional and global economy, Tachileik Airport will remain a vital link between the country and its neighbors. Mann Yadanarpon Airlines, Mingalar Aviation Services, and Myanmar National Airlines serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a custom passenger terminal, an accurate runway elevation profile, custom ground service equipment, and more. â It's available on SimMarket for roughly $6.28, requiring at least 36.86 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Barelli MSFS Addon recently released their Venice Marco Polo Airport (LIPZ) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves Venice and Padua, Italy, and has a yearly average of 9.3 million passengers. Although officially inaugurated in 1960, its roots can be traced back to the early 1920s when the first airfields in Venice were established.Â  The post-WW2 era's rebuilding effort led to the development of Venice Airport in the 1950s, ensuring it could easily accommodate the predicted traffic demand. Its location was strategically chosen to protect Venice's relatively fragile environment while keeping it relatively accessible to the residents.Â  The 1960s and 1970s brought significant growth in passenger figures, rapidly transforming it into one of Italy's main hubs for domestic and international travel.Â  The subsequent decades brought terminal improvements and runway extensions to accommodate larger aircraft, coinciding with the rise of low-cost carriers in Europe, which also significantly boosted passenger figures at the time. In 2002, a new passenger terminal was built, designed by Antonio Citterio. It featured state-of-the-art infrastructure at the time. It's a focus city for easyJet, Ryanair, Volotea and Wizz Air. Aegean, Aer Lingus, Air Arabia, Air Cairo, Air Canada, Air France, Air Transat, American Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, ITA, KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Portugal, and United Airlines also serve it. The scenery features custom ground textures, custom ground service equipment, custom jetways, custom night lighting, landside buildings, and more. â It's available on SimMarket for roughly $18.32, requiring at least 225.84 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MKStudios has recently posted in their Discord community about the release of updates for three of their sceneries and fresh new information about the progress on DÃ¼sseldorf and Seattle-Tacoma for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. â Firstly, Zurich, Dublin, and La Guardia have been updated with compatibility fixes, further optimization, and bug corrections. The respective changelogs follow below: â They have also announced Montreal and Malaga will be their next sceneries in line for compatibility updates. They look forward to SU1 leaving beta so they can benefit from the extra stability that benefits both players and developers. â DÃ¼sseldorf (EDDL) is said to be progressing well and is scheduled to release in Spring (March to May). Thanks to the community, they have been able to get insider pictures, which will aid them in achieving high detail standards. Seattle-Tacoma, on the other hand, is a few steps behind. Work has been completed on the surroundings and ground polygon, but the terminal is still being worked on. They are confident it wonât take much longer than DÃ¼sseldorf, though. Rome (LIRF) and Helsinki (EFHK) Rebooted are also in progress. Once DÃ¼sseldorf and Seattle are out of the way, they will soon enter the priority development pipeline. The expected release date is in the summer. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
