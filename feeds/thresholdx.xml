    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their rendition of Tanegashima Airport (RJFG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the town of Nakatane on Tanegashima Island in Japan and has a yearly average of 74,633 passengers. It was built roughly 19 years ago to replace the original Tanegashima Airport, which was deemed unsuitable for jet aircraft and geographically impossible to expand from its original length (1500 meters). The Tanegashima Airport was built around 8km from the original, with modern infrastructure and a slightly longer runway (2000 meters). Itâs served by J-Air and Japan Air Commuter, with flights to Osaka-Itami, Fukuoka, and Kagoshima. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a highly detailed terminal, a fully modeled boarding area, custom ground textures, custom runway textures, and more. Itâs available in the Marketplace for roughly $12.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. GotFriends recently released their rendition of the Aeroprakt A-32 Vixxen, a Ukrainian two-seat ultralight aircraft first flown in 2014, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The A-32 is built upon the A-22 Foxbat, bringing several improvements and with one significant difference: unlike its âfatherâ, which could be purchased in kit form or fully assembled, it is only available as a kit in the United Kingdom, whereas you can get a factory-built version in 31 other nations. Itâs powered by a 100hp Rotax 912ULS engine, allowing it to cruise at 213 km/h with around 4.5 hours of total endurance, carrying only one person. The first prototype was completed in January 2014, and the first production aircraft was showcased in April 2015. The A-32 is still in production today. The add-on features an accurate rendition of the aircraft, featuring a high-detail 3D model, a comprehensive EFB, two flight deck configurations (standard six-pack, glass), and much more. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $25, requiring at least 2.83 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Aerosoft Publishes A340-600 Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has published another A340-600Â  development update in conjunction with ToLiss Simulation Software, which handles the intricate systems of the long-awaited aircraft. This weekâs update goes in depth about the aircraftâs fuel and electric systems and how they differ from the rest of the A320 family due to the extra two engines and the many challenges that come with it, such as the necessity for a fuel transfer system that gets in action during take-off and landing to ensure the center of gravity is within a safe zone. While the fuel transfer isnât visually demonstrated, it is described by Torsten - ToLiSS founder and CEO -, where it kicks in at different times throughout the flight, especially during the take-off roll and landing to ensure the center of gravity is balanced correctly, and ensuring it also accompanies its respective ECAM message, both for when it starts and for when itâs done transferring. After the halfway mark, they also cover part of the electrics and how they differ from the rest of the family, like the A340 having four generators rather than twoâas it is one per engineâoffering extra redundancy, and how the APU got its very own battery, just like the A330, so that it doesnât drain the other batteries when handling the APU startup. There is no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airfoillabs has recently shared yet another development update on their Boeing 737 MAX for X-Plane 12, with a new look at the aircraftâs ongoing systems and flight model work.Â  On the systems side, the engine model continues to evolve, with work now going into RPM behaviour, acceleration and deceleration logic, and EEC, all validated by feedback from real-world pilots. Every thrust mode has also been replicated.Â  Meanwhile, the flight model has been retuned across all regimes to better capture the aircraftâs aerodynamic subtleties, including spoiler and flap dynamics, during takeoff and approach. Elsewhere, Airfoillabs has worked on the 3D and texture front, such as cockpit windows, fuselage textures, and lighting effects. FMS and VNAV are also progressing steadily, with altitude and speed constraints, climb profiles, and vertical path logic all in active development.Â  You can also watch a YouTube video from the update here: While thereâs still a way to go before release, Airfoillabs 737 MAX looks to be shaping up to be something special.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Miltech Simulations has recently published its October development blog, outlining progress across several of its big projects, including updates for the MH-60, Mission Hub, and Skyraider. New details on the U-2 Spyplane and CH-53 have also been shared. Miltech confirmed plans to gradually phase out MSFS 2020 development by 2026, citing the majority of users having already moved to MSFS 2024.Â  The MH-60, developed in partnership with Blackbird Simulations, remains one of Miltechâs flagship aircraft, and recently joined the Marketplaceâs Top-Rated Aircraft Sale.Â  A major v1.0.3 update is on the way, featuring an overhaul ofÂ  APU logic, improved flight model and SAS behaviour, and AFCS refinements.Â  The patch also introduces optional realistic INS alignment, new keybind support, and pop-out gauge functionality for multi-monitor setups.Â  In addition, the first Livery Pack is nearly complete, adding a nice selection of military and rescue variants from the US Navy, 160th SOAR, and other international operators. Meanwhile, the Miltech Mission Hub is preparing for its long-awaited Xbox release, with both MSFS 2020 and 2024 versions in final testing.Â The update introduces sling load enhancements, a distance measuring tool, new SAR scenarios, and expanded SimObjects including vehicles, ships, and rescue assets.Â  A Mission Builder App is also in development, allowing players to upload and share missions directly from the cloud. The upcoming Skyraider, also developed with Blackbird Simulations, has entered beta testing and is described as feature-complete for MSFS 2020, with a full conversion to the modular MSFS 2024 framework.Â  Miltech said that the project will include multiple variants, including the A-1H, AD-3W, AEW.1, and AD-4W, each tied to specific liveries. Pricing is expected to land in the mid-$20 USD range, covering all variants, and the aircraft will support both PC and Xbox platforms at launch. Also in active development is the U-2, a passion project that originally began in early 2023. Miltech is building both S (digital) and R (analogue) variants, with complex avionics systems, new ground equipment, and fully modelled chase cars.Â  The aircraft will come with five detailed airbases,Â  including Groom Lake (Area 51), Fairford, and Akrotiri, and will feature dynamic missions built for Mission Hub.Â  While no release window has been given, the developer notes that additional resources have been dedicated to bringing the project up to modern standards. Rounding out the lengthy blog, Miltech provided a brief look at the CH-53, showcasing its intricate rotor hub and configurable cabin layouts.Â  Both the CH-53E and MH-53E variants are in progress, leveraging MSFS 2024âs modular framework for high detail and performance efficiency.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Burning Blue Design has recently released a comprehensive pack of solar farms across the United Kingdom and Ireland, allowing VFR pilots to navigate more accurately during their virtual journeys. Over 1700 distinct solar farms total 210 square kilometers of custom scenery area (larger than the city of Dublin), featuring a variety of sizes and layouts, from tiny solar farms to massive behemoths spanning over 3 square kilometers of area. The product is made with full PBR texturing to ensure it will shimmer and reflect realistically regardless of the weather conditions. Furthermore, the developers have ensured that every little detail is captured: custom-modelled solar panels, inverters, and substations, with performance-friendliness in mind (multiple levels of detail). They also ensure that it blends seamlessly with the terrain. Itâs available on their website for roughly $15.

    <title>Black Square Releases Beechcraft Baron &amp; Bonanza Bundle for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/69025efe10a5a0a6dfa70b45_bundle1.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Black Square has recently released an aircraft bundle with the Beechcraft Baron and Bonanza for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Unlike their earlier steam gauge overhaul add-ons, this bundle features its own 3D models and custom sounds.Â  The bundle brings one of the most technically advanced simulations for Microsoft Flight Simulator (according to the developer), with an intricate reciprocating engine simulation, over a hundred possible failures, 12 hot-swappable radio configurations, and a custom turbocharger, pressurization, and cabin temperature simulation.Â  Furthermore, Black Squareâs new Electronic Flight Bag allows you to configure the aircraft, manage payload and failures, monitor engines, electric schematics, and more. On top of that, the custom failure system features persistent wear, MTBF, and scheduled failures for nearly every component in the aircraft, and the tridimensional gauges are subject to the laws of physics, meaning they can become stuck and require tapping on the glass to become unstuck again. In the navigation department, there are multiple navigation suites to choose from, ranging from various eras of both planesâ long history: from a humble no-GPS Bendix-King RNAV system to a modern Garmin GTN 650/750 (PMS or TDS), a slightly humbler GNS 530/430 combo, or the classic KLN 90-B. It also features the KFC 150 autopilot, the RDR1150XL weather radar, and more. The Beechcraft Baron set includes three distinct airframes: the normally aspirated B58, the B58TC, and the B58P. The latter is from the early 2000s, and the former two are from the 1980s. It also accompanies six different interiors and nine different liveries. On the other hand, the Bonanza set also includes three variations: the A36, the A36TC with an aftermarket turbo-normalising package, and the B36TP turboprop conversion. Similarly, it also sports six interiors and nine liveries. Overall, the package includes an entirely custom exterior model, a custom sound pack from Boris Audio Works, higher-quality materials, fine-tuned performance tables, more avionics options, and much more. The bundle is available on the Just Flight store for roughly $64.99, requiring at least 3.9 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Carenado Teases B390 IA for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has recently teased the development and imminent release of a B390 IA rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a light business jet designed and manufactured by Beechcraft. â The Beechcraft B-390 Premier IA was an updated version of the Premier 1, which was designed in the mid-90s, first flown in 1998, and certified in 2001. The IA was like a real-life patch to fix some lingering issues with the project, such as the subpar brakes, noisy cabin, and cockpit, which many deemed below par. Said upgrade rolled out in 2006, and over 163 new Premiers were built in five years. â The little jet is powered by two Williams FJ44-2A Turbofan engines. It cruises at 841 km/h, has a range of 950 miles, a service ceiling of 41,000 feet, and, depending on the configuration, can carry 6 to 7 passengers. â Thereâs no information regarding pricing or a release date, but Threshold will keep you informed!
