    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SiamFlight recently released their rendition of Tachileik Airport (VYTL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which serves the homonymous town of Tachileik in Myanmar. Established in the late 1940s, when Myanmar was undergoing significant changes following its independence from British colonial rule, it initially only featured basic infrastructure, with a very modest airstrip whose only goal was to facilitate transportation in the mountainous region, which was largely underdeveloped at the time. Its strategic location near the Thai border historically transformed Tachileik into a gateway for trade and cultural exchange between Myanmar and Thailand. During a good part of the 20th century, when Myanmar's economy became increasingly isolated due to political instability and international sanctions, Tachileik became a key hub for informal cross-border trade in textile, electronics, and agricultural products. In the 1980s and 1990s, as Myanmar began to open up its economy cautiously, Tachileik Airport saw gradual improvements in its infrastructure. The government recognized the potential of the airport to boost tourism and regional trade, particularly with Thailand. During this period, the airport was upgraded to accommodate larger aircraft, and regular flights from Yangon and Mandalay were introduced. This development was part of a broader effort by the Myanmar government to promote tourism in the Shan State, which is known for its scenic landscapes, ethnic diversity, and cultural heritage. Despite its successes, Tachileik Airport has faced numerous challenges over the years. The region's remote location and underdeveloped infrastructure have often hindered its growth. Moreover, political instability and ethnic conflicts in Shan State have occasionally disrupted airport operations and deterred tourists. However, in recent years, the Myanmar government has tried to modernize the airport and improve its facilities. Upgrades to the runway, terminal building, and navigation systems have enhanced safety and accommodated larger aircraft. Looking to the future, Tachileik Airport is poised to play an even more significant role in the region's development. Plans for further upgrades and expansion are underway to transform the airport into a major regional hub. The ongoing development of the East-West Economic Corridor, a key initiative under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program, is expected to enhance Tachileik's connectivity and economic potential. As Myanmar continues integrating into the regional and global economy, Tachileik Airport will remain a vital link between the country and its neighbors. Mann Yadanarpon Airlines, Mingalar Aviation Services, and Myanmar National Airlines serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a custom passenger terminal, an accurate runway elevation profile, custom ground service equipment, and more. â It's available on SimMarket for roughly $6.28, requiring at least 36.86 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Barelli MSFS Addon Releases Venice Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67c1f7dbdfbb0decb95e5891_venice1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Barelli MSFS Addon recently released their Venice Marco Polo Airport (LIPZ) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves Venice and Padua, Italy, and has a yearly average of 9.3 million passengers. Although officially inaugurated in 1960, its roots can be traced back to the early 1920s when the first airfields in Venice were established.Â  The post-WW2 era's rebuilding effort led to the development of Venice Airport in the 1950s, ensuring it could easily accommodate the predicted traffic demand. Its location was strategically chosen to protect Venice's relatively fragile environment while keeping it relatively accessible to the residents.Â  The 1960s and 1970s brought significant growth in passenger figures, rapidly transforming it into one of Italy's main hubs for domestic and international travel.Â  The subsequent decades brought terminal improvements and runway extensions to accommodate larger aircraft, coinciding with the rise of low-cost carriers in Europe, which also significantly boosted passenger figures at the time. In 2002, a new passenger terminal was built, designed by Antonio Citterio. It featured state-of-the-art infrastructure at the time. It's a focus city for easyJet, Ryanair, Volotea and Wizz Air. Aegean, Aer Lingus, Air Arabia, Air Cairo, Air Canada, Air France, Air Transat, American Airlines, Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, ITA, KLM, LOT, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Portugal, and United Airlines also serve it. The scenery features custom ground textures, custom ground service equipment, custom jetways, custom night lighting, landside buildings, and more. â It's available on SimMarket for roughly $18.32, requiring at least 225.84 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MKStudios has recently posted in their Discord community about the release of updates for three of their sceneries and fresh new information about the progress on DÃ¼sseldorf and Seattle-Tacoma for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. â Firstly, Zurich, Dublin, and La Guardia have been updated with compatibility fixes, further optimization, and bug corrections. The respective changelogs follow below: â They have also announced Montreal and Malaga will be their next sceneries in line for compatibility updates. They look forward to SU1 leaving beta so they can benefit from the extra stability that benefits both players and developers. â DÃ¼sseldorf (EDDL) is said to be progressing well and is scheduled to release in Spring (March to May). Thanks to the community, they have been able to get insider pictures, which will aid them in achieving high detail standards. Seattle-Tacoma, on the other hand, is a few steps behind. Work has been completed on the surroundings and ground polygon, but the terminal is still being worked on. They are confident it wonât take much longer than DÃ¼sseldorf, though. Rome (LIRF) and Helsinki (EFHK) Rebooted are also in progress. Once DÃ¼sseldorf and Seattle are out of the way, they will soon enter the priority development pipeline. The expected release date is in the summer. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Originally built in 1979, the airport was part of a network the newly formed home rule government created to connect Greenlandâs residents domestically. International flights from Nuuk Airport began in 1981 when Air Greenland introduced a route to Iqaluit, Canada. This service operated for 13 years before it was discontinued in 1994. It was briefly reinstated from 2012 to 2015 but was closed once again. In 2024, the route reopened as a summer service. The challenges faced by Nuuk Airport for international travel highlighted the need for a new and improved airport. The airport reopened in November of last year following an extensive transformation. It features a 2,200-meter runway as well as a new passenger terminal and control tower, making it one of Greenlandâs largest construction projects. Nuuk is the main hub for Air Greenland, which operates a fleet of Dash 8 aircraft, an Airbus A330-800, a Beechcraft King Air, and various helicopters. In the coming months, United, SAS, and Icelandair will also operate into Greenlandâs capital. The developer states that the scenery features meticulously crafted interior and exterior models, accurate lighting, signage, and layout. It also includes hand-made terrain around the airport, several points of interest in the city of Nuuk, and runway lighting and Navigation Aids modelled as per recent charts. It is available on the FSimStudios website, Contrail and Orbx for $14.99, requiring at least 2.79 GB to install. â Stay tuned to Threshold for all of your flight simulation news!Â  â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently announced the development of a new Brisbane Airport (YBBN) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, which will significantly enhance the previous version.Â  It is the largest airport in Australia by land area and the third busiest in passenger traffic, with a yearly average of 23.2 million passengers. The airportâs construction started in 1980. Built by Leighton Contractors, it cost 400 million dollars and opened eight years later. It initially had a domestic terminal and two runways. Nearly a decade later, in September 1995, the international terminal was inaugurated, bringing in further passenger traffic. In 2007, the government approved the construction of a new parallel runway, which was expected to take eight years to build on swamp land 2 kilometers west of the terminal area. The unexpectedly long construction time was due to the settling period of the 13,000,000 cubic meters of sand gathered from Moreton Bay to cover the swamp. Work was completed in 2020, costing $1 billion and taking precisely eight years from start to finish. Itâs a hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia. Air Canada, Air Niugini, Alliance Airlines, American Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, EVA Air, Fiji Airways, FlyPelican, Jetstar, Korean Air, Link Airways, National Jet Express, Nauru Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, QantasLink, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Skytrans Airlines, Solomon Airlines, United Airlines, VietJet Air, and Virgin Australia also serve it. The new rendition features an up-to-date layout, a high-resolution orthophoto of the surroundings, improved landside detail, better ground polygons, realistic lighting, and enhanced airside clutter.Â  An upgrade path will be available for V1 owners to access all the new features.Â  Thereâs no release date and pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <title>PMDG Publishes Progress Update on Upcoming Products for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777200"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update covering their progress on the upcoming 777-200ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the compatibility of the 77W and 77F with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and more. Randazzo begins with good news on the 777-200ERâs testing programâs process, which is said to be running well. They have spent most of this week ensuring the engine performance metrics are accurate, including EPR, N2, fuel flows, resulting thrust values, etc.Â  It has also been simultaneously tested in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with an MSFS 2020/2024 release in mind, all from a single purchase.Â  â They have also confirmed it will come with over 30 liveries, which will be managed via the new operations center, which is set to be released shortly before the 777-200ER. They already have a set date on the calendar for the upcoming bird, but they want to clear a few things up before committing to a specific date. â The 777-300ER and the 77F will also be updated in concurrency with the 777-200ER, including numerous fixes, adjustments, adaptations, and improvements.Â  â PMDG has also been working on improving the sound environment with the help of some development partners (surely with the MSFS 2024 update in mind). â As part of their commitment to the customers, the 77W/77F owners will receive the MSFS 2024 update for free. â The PMDG DC-6, initially rather disastrous in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 due to laggy animations, has been mostly fixed, and they are working fast to get it out as soon as possible. Changes include lighting adjustments, surface tweaks, and more. â Similarly, as with the 777 lineup, the DC-6 update will be free for current owners. â The 737 is still being worked on, and they have not evaluated the effort thoroughly yet due to being busy with the 777 fleet and the DC-6, but the new cabin model is being merged in, and they are well underway with re-engineering the sound environment.Â  â The MAX project is still on hold due to the need to maintain professional separation between retail simming work and work on enterprise-level projects. Once they are clear of that obligation, work will resume. â Work on their 747 is also said to be coming along nicely. Systems integration for the flight engineerâs panel and sound sourcing from a real unit are their current priorities. Â  They have also started mapping out the behaviors that will be needed to give the user a reliable flight engineer and first officer, ensuring unparalleled ease of use for the more casual demographic while also allowing you to get no hand-holding whatsoever if so desired. â In unusual fashion for PMDG, a few images of the landing gearâalbeit without textures onâwere also shared: PMDG anticipates it being their most visually detailed product yet, built from the ground up with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in mind. Randazzo anticipated that this could potentially lead to questions regarding a potential MSFS 2020 availability, and the answer for now is âI donât know.âÂ  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Magknight has released an update for the Magknight 787: Aviator's Edition, now at version V1.11.5. While the changelog is brief, this update introduces the final variant of the aircraft, the Boeing 787-10, to the add-on. Additionally, it includes several fixes. The most noticeable feature of the latest update is the introduction of the Boeing 787-10 variant, which is the longest version of the 787 series now available for virtual pilots. Itâs important to note that the 787-10 is only compatible with X-Plane 12, whereas the 787-9 and 787-8 variants can be used with both X-Plane 12 and X-Plane 11. In addition to the new variant, the update includes improvements in pitch sensitivity and the FMA pitch limiter, as well as ensuring that the aileron lockout returns at high speed. The newly updated Magknight 787: Aviator's Edition is now available on X-Plane.Org Software Store for $44.95. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Just Flight recently published a new development update for their upcoming Fokker 70/100 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which provides information on the overall status, new features, and more. They have been busy recently working on basic aircraft systems such as lift dumpers, airbrake, external and internal (flight deck) lighting, and polished LCD backlights.Â  Some time has also been spent on the more complex aircraft systems, mostly related to the EFIS (Electronic Flight Information System), which includes implementing the FWS (Flight Warning System), monitoring aircraft systems for both normal and abnormal situations, and displaying various memos, alerts, messages, and procedures on the MFDUs. The autopilot has undergone in-depth testing to ensure everything works across all areas of the envelope without throwing any surprises like a nose-dive into the ground.Â  With the systems starting to come together, they have stepped up the testing with the involvement of F100 pilots and engineers. Said process is said to take a while due to the inherently complex nature of a modern airliner. As the F100 systems reach maturity, they will soon turn their attention to the F70, which will require some changes to the cockpit panels and tweaks to the flight model to account for its shorter fuselage length, lower weight, and different engine performance. The next stepâwhich is set to start next monthâis integrating the sounds from Sim Acoustics. Their team âcannot waitâ to get their hands on it and share footage of the new sounds in action when possible.Â  Just Flight will delve deeper into the systems when the time comes.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlightSim Studios has recently updated the B727 to version 1.0.8, which brings the new Sperry-150 Autopilot, reworked forward pedestal and the Flightplan clipboard. One of the biggest features of this update is the new Sperry-150 autopilot. Produced by the Sperry Flight Dynamics in the 1960s, this rather antique specimen of the autopilot system was capable of following simple tasks such as altitude hold, heading select, IAS/pitch hold, and approach modes. The developers have also included key bindings for the autopilot functions, allowing users to set up the controls to their liking. Another new feature is the update to the GNS-XLS, which now allows the manual entry of airways. The forward pedestal panel also has a new addition - a dummy weather and terrain radar screen. The first update of the year has also brought improved sounds and sound positioning, fuel system overhaul, and the Flightplan clipboard, where you can import your SimBrief flight-plan, and move it between the Flight Engineer station or the forward pedestal, right next to the navigational computer of your choice. The full changelog of bug fixes and new features can be found below:Â  â Improvements: Features: The B727 Freighter can be purchased on the Aerosoft store or the Contrail for roughly $36.20 and requires at least 3.5GB of free disk space â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Flightbeam Studios recently updated their rendition of San Francisco International Airport (KSFO), ensuring compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and introducing enhanced ground textures, performance-optimized assets, built-in native VDGS, and more. The update takes advantage of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs modern SDK to further improve their rendition of San Francisco International, now without barriers imposed by the previous platformâs limitations: it would enforce, for example, a default detail map on all aprons, which is no longer the case, allowing Flightbeam to further increase the quality on the ground textures with higher resolution samples, more oil stains, tire marks and gunk, accurately matching the real counterpart. Furthermore, every single asset in the scenery was re-optimized and re-exported for the best possible performance. It also brings a native VDGS system on A, B, E, and G gates, completely custom taxiway lights with correct runway entry/exit colors, diverse fauna and flora around the airport, and new scanned assets from their multiple visits to SFO in real life. The update is completely free for previous owners, and new purchasers can find it on Contrail for roughly $13.29 (promotional price), requiring at least 2.44 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Navigraph Launches Community Survey 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the seventh edition of their FlightSim Community Survey. The Survey asks various questions about preferred platforms, add-ons, use cases, preferences, etc. It provides great insight into the modern flight sim demographic, thus making it easier for the industry to understand what the simmers really want. Unusually, the Survey was delayed until early 2025 so Navigraph could more comprehensively and accurately capture the community's sentiment due to the large number of major releases near the end of last year. Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â  It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilot's license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â  The Survey will run for ten days starting today (March 7), and the results will be published shortly after. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â  Click here to participate in the world's most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued a new update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing further WASM stability, bug fixes, and two new features. Marked by a controversial launchâwith a creator even asking for a refundâupdate v1.0.2 aims to get their ultimate airliner experience back on track with enhanced WASM stability, a substantial amount of bug fixes, and two new features: the A350 MORA (Minimum Off-Route Altitude) implementation and the Secondary Navigation Display, which provides backup navigation should the primary flight management system be unavailable or degraded. They have also made a note on the many community mods that supposedly improve the A350âs flight model: âComments and updates from the community regarding flight model cfgs are mostly irrelevant, or a placebo effect, as they have little to no effect on how the aircraft performs in sim. We have tuned the plane to fly as closely to real life with the support of our technical working group and A350 pilots teamâ, concluded iniBuilds, while also addressing one of the mod files and their direct impact â or lack thereof â on the flight model: Mod File Feature List: â Major Flight Stability Increases (aircraft should feel much heavier on the controls, will be improved on) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Corrected Reference Speeds (Overspeed Limits increased, set to real values) Overspeed and Cruise Mach iniBuilds: Fixed in v1.01Â  Â  Reduced Thrust Multiplier (lower overall thrust output). iniBuilds: Only effects total thrust. Reducing it as indicated will have a negative/unrealistic impact on SRS Â  Increased Ground Friction (initial roll requires thrust increase) iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback.Â  Â  Reduced Elevator Trim Speed (slightly) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler-on Deploy timing (mostly in-flight, the spoilers seem unaffected) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Can be adjusted slightly in cfgâs but this is not realistic.Â  Â  Custom Flight Dynamics Overhaul. iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Flare and Rotation Behavior (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler Deployment (looking into this, may not be needed after V1.0.1). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Fuel Flow Scalar (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Climb-Lift Ratios. iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback. Â  Brake Changes (higher priority, looking into this also). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  â The complete changelog for the update is available here.Â  The A350 Airliner is available for purchase at the iniBuilds Store for roughly $76.16, requiring at least 10.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.
