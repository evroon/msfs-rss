    <summary>Sim: FS24. Five weeks after the aircraftâs initial release, FlightFX has issued version 1.3.6 of its C750 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing the Citation X's first big update. The update introduces a wide-ranging set of refinements across the aircraftâs visuals, handling, and systems, alongside improvements to its integrated V.A.M.S. 2.0 interface.Â  Key changes include the addition of a VR collision mesh and a new co-pilot camera view. Exterior lighting has been overhauled, with corrected intensities, positions and rotations, as well as LED-style strobe and beacon lights, for winglet-equipped airframes. Improvements were also made to the cabin lighting LODs. Graphical fixes have addressed texture gaps and lighting misalignments, while sound changes were made to engine start volume, wind noise and exterior exhaust tones. The FADEC logic now better handles low-altitude cruise thrust, and high-altitude fuel flow discrepancies have been adjusted. Furthermore, ground handling has been retuned, with a focus on tiller sensitivity and yaw behaviour, plus a new option to separate rudder and tiller inputs. Thrust reverser logic has been significantly revised, with faster bucket deployment, smoother N1 ramping, and more consistent autothrottle transitions. Avionics fixes range from functional autopilot disengagement to SimBrief import errors and VSD indicators. Support for 8.33 kHz spacing has been added, alongside improvements to crossbleed logic, TOD behaviour and flight plan sequencing. The Virtual Aircraft Management System (V.A.M.S.) has seen some targeted fixes as well, including chock logic, tablet stability in third-party views, and toggle settings for tiller control. A redundant OpenStreetMap link has also been removed for clarity. For the full changelog, use this link to visit FlightFXâs Discord server. FlightFX has also updated the accompanying instruction manual, available for free on Google Drive.Â  The FlightFX Cessna Citation X is available exclusively on the in-sim Marketplace, for $29.99.

    <title>Fenix Simulations Updates A320 Lineup for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fenix2225"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68b6deaeeed0fac006e17121_fenixlol.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations has recently issued a new update to their A320 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, introducing tweaks to the fly-by-wire roll, an autothrust overhaul, and performance improvements. Update 2.4.0.2225 is the first update after the so-called âBig Fenix Updateâ, further enhancing the work on the flight model with fly-by-wire ground roll improvements, and a complete rebuild of the autothrust system, replicating how the real A320 behaves with broader tolerances and targeting smoothness rather than responsively abrupt as it used to be before, being almost âtoo goodâ rather than delivering a real representation of how the system truly works.Â  The new autothrust is said to be âslightly more intelligentâ than before and might be a few knots off the target speed. However, that is because it works within the internally defined tolerances to smooth out any necessary changes, making the flight more comfortable and fuel efficient.Â  Furthermore, soft cruise was also tweaked, with more deviation during the ALT CRZ phase, to ensure passenger comfort by trading energy across speed and altitude to avoid changing thrust. While this system was in place beforehand, the old autothrust behavior would not allow it to kick in properly. â The fly-by-wire roll was also tweaked to achieve closer results to the real counterpart, with a greater sense of inertia on the roll axis. They validated the behavior on three different Level D simulators, where all of them behaved differently to an extent, but they managed to find a middle ground using a mixture of the Level D testing, pilot feedback, and the datasets they used to adjust their control responses. They have adapted their roll PID controllers for better granular control, adding a new damping channel for certain conditions, allowing for greater control overall. â The new update also improves the sounds - especially the CFM56 engine variant -and the core display rendering system has been changed, aiming to simplify it for everyone, while increasing its robustness and performance. The complete changelog for the update follows below: Avionics and Systems â â Art and Sound â â EFB â Fenixâs A320 lineup is available on their website for $120.90 (full bundle), or $67.17 (A320 only) + $53.73 (A319+A321).Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>TFDi Design Shares Work on MD-11 Update, Xbox/MSFS 2024 support</title>
    <updated>2025-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mdsepu"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TFDi Design has posted a sizeable development update on its MD-11, covering progress across art, systems, and the new Extended Simulation package. While the original 60-day target for MSFS 2024 support has now slipped, the aircraft is receiving a significant visual overhaul, enhanced systems depiction, and a clearer roadmap, towards both MSFS 2024 and Xbox. As previously teased, the aircraft has received a major art overhaul, starting with a completely rebuilt exterior model. Animations have been corrected, surface textures reworked, and missing details have been filled in. Service ports now carry legible labels, while flap and slat internals animate with a new layer of mechanical fidelity, with more physical parts depicted. Rivets, dirt, and fine panel work have also seen major attention, overall raising the visual fidelity of the aircraft. Furthermore, Pratt &amp; Whitney engine options will be released alongside the upcoming art update. Behind the scenes, the throttle control system and engine simulation have also been reworked. Moving to the interior, the cabin has seen a similar overhaul of visual fidelity, being almost entirely reworked. Included are new textures, remodelled geometry, and glass/rain surface effects on the windows, with the team also hinting at a few surprises yet to be shown.Â  In the cockpit, smaller missing items are being addressed, including the manual gear handle, oxygen test buttons, and a few immersion items, including openable cockpit windows. Another large iteration on the code side is the Extended Simulation package. TFDi has implemented more than 160 failure scenarios, with user controls to adjust likelihood and scope, so that IVAO and VATSIM flying remains viable.Â  A new maintenance system has replaced the instant âfix allâ pop-ups with maintenance flows, repairs, and routine service checks. Each airframe also builds its own local log over time, tracking its own maintenance history. When it comes to core systems, PROF descent logic has been overhauled for steadier vertical profiles, step climbs now handle multiple S/C and T/C points, and support for ATO waypoints has been added. A custom simulation for oil, vibration, and EGT has also been implemented across both P3D and MSFS, alongside display improvements and many bug fixes. While the art update and Extended Simulation package are nearly complete for MSFS PC, work on FS24 is taking longer than expected. TFDi plans to split the model where necessary, adopt the simâs new texture streaming format, and integrate FS24-native features, so the aircraft feels at home in the new platform. Xbox releases are expected to land alongside FS24 PC, once testing is complete. There is still no firm release date.Â  TFDi reports that QA feedback on the refreshed model and Extended Simulation has been positive, and the team maintains that it remains focused on delivering the MD-11 as "originally envisioned". The team admits the delay is not ideal, but states the wait will be "worth it", and TFDi characterises the remaining work as a matter of âa few weeksâ.Â  â For the full details, you can read TFDi's development update on their website.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design has recently released the F33A Bonanza for X-Plane 12, positioning the classic Beechcraft as the next step in the studioâs Dynamic Generation Series.Â  As with other aircraft in the Dynamic Generation Series, the Bonanzaâs panel is not fixed in place. More than 60 instruments can be mixed and matched, moved between pilot and co-pilot positions, and saved as reusable presets. Support is included for RealityXP, as well as TDS GTN 650/750 units, GNS 430/530 swaps, and even G1000-style layouts, allowing the aircraft to be configured to suit various training needs, vintage tastes, or IFR touring preferences. Paintwork is handled in-sim, through Thrandaâs dynamic livery editor. Liveries can be adjusted on the fly, with colour selection, roughness and metallic variables, and optional wear layers, before being rasterised to the textures for later use.Â  The EFB provides options such as covers, chocks, doors, and lighting, a visual weight and balance tool, ground handling, a panel layout editor, and quality-of-life apps, including checklists, a logbook view, and AviTab integration, when installed. Tip tanks can also be toggled from the EFB, with corresponding changes to weight, drag, and handling. Under the skin, the model is built around 8k textures and full PBR materials, with per-instrument post-lighting and rain effects. An FMOD sound set is used for sounds, layering cockpit clicks, airflow cues, and exterior perspectives, aiming to reflect changes in load, slip, and angle of attack. The Continental IO-520-B piston engine is modelled with detailed performance envelopes, and the electrical system includes buses, tie breakers, and failure modes. Thranda says flight dynamics were tuned with input from real-world F33A pilots, so numbers for take-off, climb, cruise, and landing are intended to sit close to the book, while still leaving room for the Bonanzaâs quirks, when pushed. For upkeep, support forr the SkunkCraft Updater is in place to handle incremental changes. Feature-rich Universal Electronic Flight Bag (UEFB) with pop-up/pop-out capability with the following features: For full feature information, visit the F33A's product page. The Thranda Design F33A Bonanza is available via the X-Plane.org Store for $37.95, currently on a 16% discount. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.3.0 Beta, Weather Update, Aircraft Rework</title>
    <updated>2025-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1230"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68b9902421a2d9942ee67742_WXRUpdate_TItle_3%20(1).webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has just rolled out the first beta of X-Plane 12.3.0, and it is one of the most ambitious updates we have seen yet. Headlining the release is a fully simulated weather radar system, alongside a major overhaul of the default Airbus A330, and a bundle of new tools for both pilots and developers. The new weather radar is available across several default aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A330-300, Citation X, and Baron 58. Being fully simulated, the system is capable of tilt and gain control, turbulence detection, ground clutter suppression and more, with accurate attenuation and reflections. For GA flyers, the X1000 GPS now integrates radar returns directly onto the display, and the Baron has received an open-source Bendix RDR2000 implementation. This new functionality, however, only integrates with the default fleet at launch, where third-party developers can integrate the new technology with their own updates, should they want to. As part of this beta, Laminar Research has also reworked the native Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), which should result in better terrain and obstacle alerts, when flying into challenging conditions. Combined with the weather radar, situational awareness takes a serious leap forward in 12.3.0. The default Airbus A330 has not been left out either, and the widebody was given a âcomplete overhaulâ. The exterior now sports micro-textures, subtle dirt and weathering effects, and even animated engine wobble. Inside, both cockpit and cabin lighting have been rebuilt with backlit instruments, spill lighting, dynamic cabin lamps, and even an auto-adjusting cabin brightness function. Moving on to systems, work has been done on refining VNAV logic, flight control laws, and autopilot behaviour, while also introducing a functional SEC F-PLN: Secondary Flight Plan Page.  Another big addition is Synthetic Vision for the X1000 avionics, a feature widely used in modern GA avionics. This system can paint a 3D representation of terrain, runways, and obstacles directly onto the Primary Flight Display, ensuring safer low-visibility operations. Not content with just systems and avionics, Laminar has also added a new, hand-crafted rendition of Dubai International Airport (OMDB) in the United Arab Emirates. The airport features custom terminal buildings and detailed surroundings, making the worldâs busiest international hub a more authentic stopover for long-haul operations in the sim. Another subtle addition in is the new Engine Health system, this being a fully native wear-and-tear implementation. Here, developers can assign different âagesâ to each engine at load, so one might behave like a well-worn unit with 7.7 years behind it, while the other is a fresher 3.2 years old. This results in small variations in spool-up times, fuel flow, and overall efficiency, between the two powerplants.  Elsewhere, X-Plane 12.3.0 now introduces the option to load historical weather conditions up to a year in the past, allowing real-world flights or test scenarios to be recreated under authentic conditions.Â Scenery developers have also gained some new tools, including vegetation annotations for 3D objects, updated ground textures, and fresh airport assets. For cockpit builders, avionics displays, such as the G1000 and G530, can now be assigned directly to hardware screens, rather than pop-ups. The G-Loaded Camera now comes with an intensity slider, and a command to suspend the effect altogether, based on user feedback.  You can read the feature list below: For the full list of fixes, features, and improvements, you can check out the complete release notes on the official X-Plane website. X-Plane 12.3.0 is now available for all who opt into the public beta. Steam users can join via the âbetaâ branch, while Laminar Direct customers can tick the beta box in the X-Plane 12 installer.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SamScene3D has taken the wraps off Tokyo City Times, a new cityscape add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, that reimagines Japanâs capital and its neighbour, Yokohama. The package includes over 500 handcrafted buildings, new landmarks, and more. SamScene3D describes the project as a redesign of the Tokyo and Yokohama metropolitan areas, rebuilding missing structures and fixing artefacts in the default scenery. Bridges, rivers, and textures have been cleaned up, while dozens of iconic locations have been modelled from scratch. Expect detailed JR Railway stations at Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Ginza, and Ueno, as well as shopping complexes, hotels, museums, banks, and hospitals spread across the city. Haneda Airport also sees its surroundings improved, with bespoke buildings. Helicopter pilots will find multiple landable rooftops across Tokyo City, while Yokohama comes bundled as a bonus area. Most eye-catching is the inclusion of the life-size animated Gundam statue on Yokohama Bay. The real-world version may have already been dismantled, but in MSFS, it stands tall, once again. The scenery features custom night lighting, blending hand-placed assets with MSFSâs photogrammetry, to create a vibrant, lived-in Tokyo after dark. Tokyo City Times is available from the SamScene3D store for $19.99 USD (tax included), as well as other merchants, such as Contrail, Orbx and SimMarket. Owners of the developerâs previous Tokyo Landmarks Enhanced will receive a $5 discount upon purchasing. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>PMDG Updates 777 Lineup for MSFS 2024 </title>
    <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdg777su3"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/670074421902159c8c578804_randy5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently issued a new update for their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, addressing LOD issues introduced with SU 3. Furthermore, they have also provided a new development update on their upcoming 737NG conversion for the new platform. Due to PMDGâs decision to wait until SU 3 was out to ultimately work on a fix, as Microsoft kept changing things around during the beta, it took a while longer than expected, but they are currently testing everything, and they should all be out by the weekend at the latest. â The update might take a while to land in the marketplace due to an issue with texture corruption that has yet to be fully mitigated, as they donât know the root cause. There is a temporary way to âfixâ the issue by going to the EFB and repairing the tires.Â  â The 777-200LRâs marketplace release is also being held back due to the texture corruption issue, and they hope to push it for intake before the weekend. â The long-awaited sound updates for the 777 lineup should be coming soon, with new features, layers, and proper balancing to make the sound as convincing as possible. Itâs âthe best sounds they have ever produced,â according to Randazzo, PMDGâs founder. âWe have really captured the character and vibrancy of the engines and added a bunch of new sounds from the aircraft flight deck and cabin environment that we think you will really enjoyâ, he concluded. The 737-800âs MSFS 2024 conversion is nearing completion, and they plan on handing it to their beta testers on Thursday evening (yesterday?), and they expect a quick but robust testing, meaning it should not take long. The build will include several new features, like openable cockpit windows, an openable cockpit door, and âother goodiesâ. The initial release will be the -800, as itâs the most popular model, and the rest will follow shortly after. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. AUscene has recently released their rendition of Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport (YBWW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Wellcamp, in Queensland, Australia, and has a yearly average of 157,000 passengers. The airportâs history is fairly recent, with its construction beginning in April 2013 with an ambitious timeframe: ready by October 2014. Surely enough, by November 2014, the airport was already getting its first scheduled action with Qantas, establishing a route between Wellcamp and Sydney. QantasLink currently serves it by offering flights to Sydney. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, featuring high-quality models, high-resolution aerial imagery, over 200 custom assets, custom ground clutter, custom vehicles, custom ground textures, realistic PBR textures, custom vegetation placement, and more. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $22.16, requiring at least 4.43 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Contrail Shares Development Update on Falcon 50 for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ctfa50"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Last month, Contrail published the second development update on its upcoming Dassault Falcon 50 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, offering us a glimpse at the current stage of development. The biggest milestone stated so far is that the flight model and sound package have wrapped their first development phase. The next step will see the aircraft evaluated by real-world FA50 pilots, who will put performance and fidelity under the microscope. Contrail says this testing will be crucial in ensuring the Falcon 50 behaves and sounds as close to reality as possible. Avionics and core systems are also nearing completion, while the walkaround mode in MSFS 2024 is already functional, complete with chocks, pitot and engine covers. For simmers looking ahead to MSFS 2024, the Falcon 50 will use the default EFB, but Contrail is adding its own custom app for weight and balance, ground services, and more, with full Navigraph integration baked in. Interestingly, Contrail also shed some light on the cabin blinds, which can be adjusted manually or left to move automatically as time and altitude change. It is a small but telling detail that hints at the level of immersion the team is aiming for. First announced back at FSExpo 2025, the Falcon 50 project is shaping up to be an ambitious project, this being Contrail's first in-house aircraft. With testing about to begin, and a targeted release for this year, the classic French trijet looks to be moving steadily toward the finish line. We'll keep you updated on the Contrail FA50, and future developments! If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>FlightFactor 777V2 Leaves Beta Phase, Details Future Roadmap</title>
    <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ff7rel"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68bb1b9254391719e12cc24d_777-200ER_xp12-2025-07-2303_29_27.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. After more than a year in open beta, FlightFactor has finally confirmed that its flagship 777 v2 has shed the beta tag, with the first release candidate of version 2.1.0. In practice, this means each future update will now have a stable, roll-backable build for those who value reliability, while development continues at the same pace, with fixes, refinements, and new features. Version 2.1.0 itself is a sizeable step forward. Alongside numerous fixes, it introduces a suite of training scenarios, including intercepts, TCAS events, UPRT drills, and windshear encounters, giving simmers more tools to sharpen their flying skills. Other highlights include gear door unsafe lights, a new keyboard input for the EFB performance calculator, and a clutch coupling sound. Lighting has been refined with reduced nav, strobe, and beacon brightness, while a host of bugs, from SimBrief import quirks, to emergency lighting issues, have been addressed.  The full changelog follows below: 2.1.0 Read the full release notes here. The team says the aircraft has now reached the internal milestones required to be considered âmature,â and attention has now shifted to the future roadmap. Planned additions include further engine options for the Extended Edition, deeper FMC capability (with winds and an alternate page), tighter integration of CPDLC, ACARS, EFB, and FMC, and optimised display rendering, with improved Zink compatibility. Quality-of-life updates for the EFBâs Charts and Document Viewer apps are also on the horizon. On the airframe side, FlightFactor has reiterated that additional variants are coming, including the -300ER, Freighter, and -200LR, with the first two having already been teased, during the summer months. A new weather radar is also planned, powered by the new X-Plane weather API introduced in the 12.3.0 beta.  You can read FlightFactor's full roadmap here. Support, bug tracking, and community discussion remain centred on the 777 Club on X-Plane.org, with a dedicated forum for the v2 Ultimate. With the beta label removed, the focus now is on steady iteration, broader variant coverage, and completing long-requested systems. The FlightFactor 777V2 is available for purchase on the X-Plane.org store for $89.00, requiring at least 7 GB of free disk space to install.
