    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Final Approach Design Studios recently released their version of Sylhet Airport (VGSY) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Officially known as Osmani International Airport, the airport serves the Bangladeshi city of Sylhet. The airport is the third busiest in the country and is located around 5 miles from the city centre. It serves an average of just under 650.000 passengers annually. Osmani International Airport was built during the period of 1944-1945. It was constructed during World War II with the purpose of controlling Japanese aggression from Burma. Initially opened as Sylhet Civil Airport, it started as a domestic airport. In 1986, a terminal building, navigational aids, new runway pavement, taxiways, and aprons were constructed. The airport saw its first international flight in 2002 and has since undergone further expansion and upgrades. Today, the airport is operated by airlines such as Biman Bangladesh Airlines and Novoair, offering flights to destinations such as Dhaka, London, and Dubai. The recently released version of Sylhet Airport features 4K PBR textures, highly detailed ground poly, detailed 3D buildings, ground service equipment, animated jetways, terminal interiors, and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ST Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of Maastricht-Aachen Airport (EHBK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Maastricht, in the Netherlands, and Aachen, in Germany, with a yearly average of 97.000 passengers. It was built by the Allies as a temporary airfield during World War 2, later transferred to the Dutch government and named Beek Airfield. It saw lots of traffic during its initial months because most roads in the country had been bombed and/or heavily damaged. As the repairs progressed, the traffic figures died down. The first semi-permanent terminal was built in 1947, followed by runway paving work in 1949 and 1950. Further expansion work was carried on from 1951 and beyond after an agreement between the airport and the Dutch Air Force. The airport underwent expansion work in the early 1970s to handle bigger aircraft, which included runway lengthening, taxiway widening, and apron enlargement. A decade later, a new passenger terminal was built, replacing the old one from the 40s. Corendon Dutch Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, and Ryanair serve it. â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, custom taxiway signage, custom objects, PBR texturing, aÂ realistic runway profile, and more.

In 1994, a brand new terminal was built, with eight gates and expansion possibilities. Five departure gates were dutifully added in 2007.Â  It won #1 Best Domestic Airport two years in a row (2021 and 2022) in Travel+Leisure Worldâs Best Awards. The method was a survey among the readers that took accessibility, shopping, check-in, restaurants, cleanliness, and many other factors into account. The airportâs domestic popularity was also reinforced by CondÃ© Nast Traveler, which ranked it the best in the United States for three years in a row. Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air and served by American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, custom jetways, and more. â Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.15, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Gate15Scenery has recently released the second version of its Rishiri Airport (RJER) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the entirety of Rishiri Island in Hokkaido Prefecture and has a yearly average of 38.000 passengers. The airport was built in the late 1960s when air travel was gaining momentum in Japan, and connecting remote islands became a priority. Initially, the airport served a limited number of flights, primarily connecting Rishiri to the nearby Wakkanai Airport on the mainland. However, its presence proved crucial in boosting tourism and facilitating the transportation of goods and services. The airport also became a vital link for emergency medical services, ensuring timely access to specialized care for the island's residents. Over the years, Rishiri Airport has witnessed steady growth. The runway was extended in 1990 to accommodate larger aircraft, allowing for more direct flights and increased passenger capacity. Today, the airport serves several domestic destinations, including Sapporo and Tokyo, making travel to and from the island more convenient. Beyond its role in transportation, Rishiri Airport has become a symbol of the island's connection to the broader world. It serves as a gateway for visitors to experience the island's natural beauty, from the majestic Mount Rishiri to its diverse marine life. It's currently only served by ANA Wings and Hokkaido Air System, with flights to Sapporo (Chitose and Okadama). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Owners of the previous version are eligible for a free upgrade. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 298.89 MB of free hard disk space to install.
