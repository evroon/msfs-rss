    <summary>Sim: FS24. Atelic has recently released their rendition of Kos International Airport (LGKO) forÂ Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Kos Island, Greece, and has a yearly average of 2.8 million passengers. It opened in early 1964, and the first expansion work was carried out within a decade, bringing the runway to 2,400m and thus enabling it to accommodate larger jet aircraft. The ever-increasing passenger traffic figures led to the construction of a new passenger terminal in 1980, which underwent renovation and expansion seventeen years later. Upon winning the airportâs concession in late 2015, Fraport was heavily committed to improving the infrastructure through heavy maintenance and upgrades and ensuring it was within the safety regulations. Itâs a focus airport for Aegean Airlines and seasonally served by Aer Lingus, airBaltic, Air Serbia, Austrian Airways, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Condor, Discover Airlines, easyJet, Enter Air, Eurowings, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Swiss, Transavia, TUI (multiple), and Wizz Air. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality PBR textures, realistic night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, detailed terminal and tower interiors, realistic terrain profile, custom vegetation, custom roads, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.32, requiring at least 2.37 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. It was quite the day in Lelystad, Netherlands, today, with FSWeekend kicking off a jam-packed weekend of announcements, presentations, and more flight sim news. Saturday saw five hours of presentations, and weâre here to round todayâs big announcements up for you right in one place! Threshold is also on the ground, covering the event in person, so if you see any of us around, feel free to say hi and chat! â First up was Sayintentions.ai, CEO Brian Shellabarger making three big announcements regarding their AI ATC add-on: AI Living World, OpenSky Beta, and SkyNet. AI Living World is Sayintentionsâ new traffic injection and sequencing feature, connecting AI traffic to their existing AI ATC. According to Shellabarger, each injected aircraft is an individual AI entity, following real-world schedules, with the AI ATC sequencing every aircraft according to actual weather conditions. AI Living World is set to launch for partner customers on April 15 for MSFS 2020 and 24, with X-Plane support coming later this year. SkyNet, Sayintentionsâ basic AI ATC service currently in closed beta, is now free. It will boast features such as premium neural voices, authentic phraseology, radio chatter, and more, all fully cloud-based. However, the service will be ATC only, limited to IFR gate-to-gate operations with little flexibility. Wrapping up their presentation was the announcement of the release of SkyNet, which is now available to all Sayintentions.ai customers for MSFS 2020 and 24. SkyNet is a real-time multiplayer network featuring model matching, cross-platform support, and the ability to create/join private groups. It will be available for the whole community early this summer, with AI sequencing and X-Plane support planned for the future. Navigraph was next, having announced a new feature for their popular Charts software called Scratchpads. Scratchpads will give users templates to write notes, such as ATIS, CRAFT clearances, and takeoff performance. No exact release date has been provided, but Navigraph CEO Magnus Axholt says it will come âvery soonâ. Swiss developers FlightSim Studio have announced the 727 Passenger for MSFS 2020, coming next month in April 2025. It features a fully modelled cabin and more. Along with that, they announced the Super 27 Expansion, which includes more powerful JT8D-217 or JT8D-219 engines and a modern avionics package with a new autopilot, FMS, EFIS, GPS, and more. According to FSS, the Super 27 Expansion will come later this year. FSS also announced progress for their E-Jets series for MSFS, which will soon include a new MCDU with support for custom nav data importing, performance improvements, new MFD modes, weather radar, enhanced LNAV, and more. However, FSS did not mention a release date for this update. Finally, there was WinWing, who announced a slew of new hardware products. On the roadmap for 2025 are additions to the Ursa Minor lineup, the MIP series, and the new Cyber Taurus joystick bases. The very popular Ursa Minor lineup will be getting an Airbus A320-style throttle quadrant and pedestal controls, priced at $127.95 and $107.95 respectively, will boast metal construction and detents, authentic backlighting, and the ability to switch between detent and detentless modes with one button. Following their highly successful MIP panel releases, WinWing announced the MIP Airline PAP 3 Panel, this time styled after the Boeing 737 MCP, which will feature full backlighting, realistic knobs, and more, for $149.95. The PAP 3 Panel can be upgraded with the MIP MAG Switch, a magnetic switch for the autothrottle function, which will be available for purchase either separately for $49.95 or pre-installed to the PAP 3 panel for $199.99. Along with the PAP 3 Panel will be the MIP Airline PDC 3N Panel, modelled after the 737 EFIS Panel, and will be available for $84.95. Concluding the MIP series additions is the MIP Combat 13 CNI-MU Panel, styled like the 737 FMC, but with combat-focused functions, priced at $129.95. Lastly, WinWing announced additions to the Cyber Taurus series, with three new joystick bases and a rudder pedal set, all being force-feedback driven. The base tier Cyber Taurus joystick base will include electronic load control, belt-driven construction, and a rated output of more than 20 NM, priced at $414.95. The higher tier, the Cyber Taurus (D) joystick base, will have two versions: a gear-reduced model and a direct drive model. The gear-reduced model will have a rated output of more than 60 NM, and the direct drive model will have a rated output of more than 16 NM. Both will be available for $699.95. Closing out their presentation, they showcased the Cyber Taurus Electronic Load Control Rudder Pedals, which will have a rated output of more than 170 NM, and a pricetag of $799.95. â That closes a very packed day at Europeâs largest flight simulation convention! But thereâs still another day, so stay tuned to Threshold for coverage of Day 2! If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Starting off the announcements today at FSWeekend, Honeycomb Aeronautical announced four new products. These new products come in two different ranges, the Flagship range, and the all new Lite range.Â  Firstly, they announced the Sierra TPM module. Following on the success of the Bravo Throttle Quadrant, the Sierra TPM module focuses on general aviation, with Cessna-style knobs instead of levers. Along with the knobs, it will come with an integrated trim wheel, parking brake, flap, and gear controls. Once available, the Sierra TPM will be priced at $249.99. Next, Honeycomb announced their entry into the joystick market with the Foxtrot Aviation Stick. Honeycomb previously had announced a similar stick in 2020, but that was back before their management debacle. This new Foxtrot stick will include a linear resistance system with adjustable tension, five two-way switches, four programmable action buttons, along with three rotary switches. However, unlike its previous iteration, the new Foxtrot Aviation Stick will not include an integrated gear lever or throttle lever. No pricing information has been released yet for the Foxtrot. Honeycomb then introduced their new Lite product lineup, featuring two new products, the Alpha Lite, and Bravo Lite. The Alpha Lite, like its more premium counterpart, features the same popular yoke design, but does not include the switch panel. When it becomes available for purchase, the Alpha Lite will be priced at $199.99. Finally, the Bravo Lite will feature four axes, an integrated trim wheel, interchangeable flap detents, and a parking brake control. It will be priced exactly the same as the Alpha Lite at $199.99 when available. Honeycomb says that all of these products will be available for purchase by Christmas this year. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Meridian GMT announced its initial product line during today's final presentation at FSWeekend. Founded by Honeycomb Aeronautical founder and former CEO Nicki Repenning, Meridian GMT hopes to break into an increasingly competitive hardware market. â Their initial lineup consists of three new products: The Sierra Plus Flight Controls, the Tango Plus Throttle Quadrant, and the X-Ray Flight Controller. Meridianâs focus for these products is a multi-purpose and modular approach. â Repenning started the presentation by showcasing the Sierra Plus (not to be confused with the Honeycomb Sierra TPM), which he says includes many improvements over his previous designs, chiefly the Honeycomb Alpha. The Sierra Plus will boast features such as swappable button and switch panels, quick-release yoke, vibration motors, and under-table mounting. Multiple panel configurations will be available for the Sierra Plus, including a commercial configuration based on the Boeing 737 and a general aviation configuration complete with a chronometer. On release, the Sierra Plus will be priced at approximately $325 (â¬299.99). Next, Repenning moved to what he says is âthe product that I am most excited aboutâ, the Tango Plus Throttle Quadrant. Like the Sierra Plus, the Tango Plus builds on previous designs' success, adding modularity, among other features. Meridian has packed the Tango Plus with features, including an annunciator panel, trim wheel, exterior light switches, auto brake knob, and more. The flagship feature of the Tango Plus is the swappable avionics and throttle configurations. Users can customize their quadrant based on the type of aircraft they are flying, with Repenning mentioning configurations for single and multi-engine general aviation, as well as configs for Airbus and Boeing, which will include detents. The avionics receive the same treatment, the general aviation config receiving a Garmin-style radio and autopilot panel, the Boeing panel styled after the 737 MCP, and the Airbus panel made to represent the FCU. Meridianâs final product is the X-Ray Flight Controller, which Repenning says is âthe product that will launch first into the marketâ. The X-Ray Flight Controller is Meridianâs answer to the increasingly popular console market, being an Xbox controller with various features specific to flight simulation. No pricing information has been announced for the Tango Plus or the X-Ray controller, but Threshold will keep you informed, so stay tuned! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/350104"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d74ca627ae5eebe484b673_104.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued an update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing system depth improvements, art tweaks, and more. Update v1.0.4 aims to increase the systems simulation further, bringing extra depth and more overall fidelity. Following customer feedback and further investigation, the art was also tweaked on the long-winglet model for the A350-900, improving its shape and profile.Â  ini has also done extra optimization work for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version by tweaking node counts and refining the system for swapping cockpits. These changes significantly reduce CPU load and bring smoother performance and fewer stutters, especially on lower-end systems. As the update changes the 3D model to some extent, all liveries will need to be redownloaded or updated to work with the new version in both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. They claim this was necessary to ensure the key fixes in the patch could be carried out at once. More WASM fixes were also introduced to enhance the productâs stability further, resolving multiple crashes related to TCAS activation, flight plan imports, and Navigraph integration.Â  The developers claim to remain dedicated to continuous improvement and deeper simulation accuracy, with ongoing refinements across all areas of the A350âs systems.Â  The complete changelog for the update follows below: v1.0.4Systems &amp; EFB âï¸ð¥ï¸Fixed -

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Announces Western Sydney International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d75244a47f8ad7c024a98c_syd1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design recently announced the development of Western Sydney International Airport (YSWS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport is set to begin operating in late 2026 and supplement Sydneyâs Kingsford Smith International, which has been operating at capacity due to a legislated curfew. After a more than decade-long debate on the location, the government officially designated the site in April 2014. It was conceived to operate 24 hours a day, with no curfews whatsoever, helping mitigate the fact Sydneyâs main airport is already operating at capacity and with limited slots. The administration has decided to build the airport in multiple phases, starting with a smaller terminal and a single runway and eventually building up as required. Phase one â which is nearing completion â consists of that one âsmallâ terminal, able to handle up to 10 million passengers a year, and a single 3700m runway. As of June 2024, the terminal was 80% ready and set to reach total completion by January 2026. Itâs going to be Australiaâs first fully digital air traffic control system, using a 45-meter-tall mast with over twenty high-definition cameras instead of a traditional control tower. The developer plans to fully utilize Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs capabilities, aiming to deliver highly detailed visuals, optimized performance, and an immersive flight simulation experience. For that, they seek reference materials, including airport documentation, high-quality images, charts, blueprints, and operational insights. If you fit the criteria, feel free to contact the developer here.Â  Thereâs no information on pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Papa Delta Studio recently released their rendition of Szczecin-GoleniÃ³w Airport (EPSC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Szczecin, Poland, and has a yearly average of 600,000 passengers. It was built as a standard military airport between 1953 and 1956 during the Cold War, with a 1,800-meter runway and basic infrastructure. It wasnât until eleven years later that it became a civilian airport. In the late 1970s, the runway was extended to 2,500 meters, and a new passenger terminal was built. Extra effort was made in the late 1990s to improve the runway and the main apron, followed by the opening of a new passenger terminal in 2001.Â  Four years after its inauguration, the new terminal underwent expansion to accommodate the predicted passenger figures for the decade. Completion was achieved a year later, in 2006. LOT Polish Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Ryanair, Smartwings Poland, and Wizz Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a high-quality terminal model, custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, custom static aircraft, custom 3D people models, custom ground service equipment, custom clutter, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $7.31, requiring at least 87.55 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>DarkBlue Releases Tokyo Haneda Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DarkBlue has recently released their rendition of Haneda Airport (RJTT) for X-Plane 11 and 12. The airport serves the Greater Tokyo Area and has a yearly average of 78.7 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in Japan. The airport started its life in 1931 as a tiny airfield with a 300-meter-long concrete runway, a small passenger terminal, and two hangars.Â  Traffic figures grew throughout the 1930s, leading to the extension of the runway to 800 meters and the construction of a newâalso 800-meter-long ârunway. The airport's land size also grew from the initial 53 hectares to 72.8 hectares.Â  It was also during that time period that the Japanese government started planning to build a new Tokyo Municipal Airport on an artificial island in Koto Ward. At the time, it was five times the size of Haneda and easily the largest airport in the world by the era's standards. Work was scheduled to start in 1939 and reach completion by 1941, but World War 2 put a permanent stop to it. Post World War 2, Haneda was occupied by the United States Army, becoming Haneda Army Air Base. Many nearby residents were evicted during that time so they could carry out further expansion to accommodate their infrastructure. Both runways were extended to 1,650 meters and 2,100 meters, respectively. By the time everything was finally completed in 1946, the airport was already occupying 257.4 hectares, slightly larger than the old Tokyo Municipal Airport project. Part of the base was returned to Japan in 1952 and named Tokyo International Airport. The remainder remained under American control until it was returned to Japan in 1958. When Japan Airlines started its domestic operations out of the airport, there was no passenger terminal. This became a reality in 1955 after two years of hard work, followed by an extension for international flights in 1963. The introduction of jet aircraft in the 1960s led to many changes and improvements, including runway extensions, the repurposing of a runway as an apron, and a new international arrivals facility. In the late 1970s, Narita Airport was inaugurated, taking most of the international service in the area and relegating Haneda to a majorly domestic airport. For the next 32 years, Haneda lived through its "domestic era," a period in which many expansion projects were carried out to ensure it could actually serve Greater Tokyo properly: a new landfill in the mid-1980s, a new passenger terminal, new runways in the late 1990s/early 2000s, and a new international terminal in 1998. â After completing a third international terminal in October 2010, the government opened the airport again to overseas operations as long as they operated between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. â The international terminal was further expanded in 2014 with a new eight-gate pier, an expanded apron, an expanded check-in, and more.Â  It's a hub for All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines and an operating base for Air Do, Skymark Airlines, Solaseed Air, and StarFlyer. Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Asiana Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, EVA Air, Finnair, Garuda Indonesia, ITA Airways, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas, Scandinavian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K textures, highly detailed passenger terminal and airport buildings, custom ground markings, an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â It's available on OrbxDirect for roughly $15.89, requiring at least 2 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. A new map has been announced by Eagle Dynamics! This time, it is a âgreen mapâ - based on Germany in the Cold War. â The map features an accurate rendition of West and East Germany in the 1980s, as well as smaller parts of Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark. The map has quite a large size 980x800km and has an accurate and faithful representation of cities such as Frankfurt am Main, Leipzig, Berlin, Magdeburg, Hannover, Lubeck, and others.Â  Aside from the cities, the map has over 100 detailed civil and military airfields with the likes of Rammstein, Spangdahlem, Hahn, Bitburg, Sembach, Tegel, SchÃ¶nefeld, Tempelhof, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Hannover. Additionally, a multitude of army bases, naval bases, training grounds, listening posts and weapons storage facilities as well as the East and West German militarized borderline have been implemented. Ugra-Media, a development group known for their work on the Syria and Normandy 2 maps, provides users with a precise rendition of rail, road networks and core infrastructure such as industrial areas, power plants, train stations, and tunnels, alongside prominent historical landmarks. As is usually the case, the initial release will mainly focus on the central part of both West and East Germany, and will only contain summer textures. Future updates and releases will of course bring more detail to the other parts of the map and bring Spring, Autumn and Winter textures!

    <title>PMDG Publishes New Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777321"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67536d0cda476a2b5d5c3f25_frei5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a new development update with further information on their effort to bring the 777 product line to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in what appears to be a âbig week for 777 testingâ. Their beta team has recently been given access to working beta builds of the 777-300ER, 777-200ER, and 777F for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. PMDG finally feels confident enough in the platform to let their testers try it out without feeling like they would be wasting their time and effort. For those unfamiliar with the saga so far, PMDG was initially somewhat skeptical about Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, not in regards to the platformâs capabilities per se but more so on the compatibility aspect, even though Asobo had promised it would be pretty straightforward to port content over. Their skepticism was proven right over time, and the transition has been anything but smooth, with the first glimmer of hope only showing up with the release of SU1 beta in January 2025. They launched an all-hands effort at the time using undocumented methods and practices for the new platform, ensuring it would not be a merely âhalf-assedâ drag-and-drop port but an actual solid conversion that would last and show their quality. The so-called herculean effort has apparently paid off, and they continue to work hard to ensure it will be stable and compliant in MSFS 2024 on PC and Xbox. â Despite sharing many common elements with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, the new platform has plenty of significant changes that were not documented yet or were partially/wrongly documented, which has contributed to slowing down the process quite substantially. â On top of ensuring compatibility, PMDG has also been hard at work upgrading the 777 product line with new MSFS 2024-only features and further polishing it with hundreds of bug fixes, tweaks, changes to handling characteristics, performance improvements, and a near-full refactor of the sound environment using new recording equipment, new processes, and even collaborating with their coding team to build even more fidelity to the airplaneâs relatively rich sound environment. â The company is excited to be testing the 777 lineup in MSFS 2024 finally (and soon the DC-6, or so they hint), but there is still no release date in mind until they know for sure itâs ready. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their official website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99 If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>iBlueYonder Releases Portland International Airport V2 for MSFS 2020</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iBlueYonder has recently released their upgraded rendition of Portland International Airport (KPDX) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, bringing its ground layout and overall infrastructure up to 2025 standards. The airport opened in 1936, replacing Portlandâs Swan Island Municipal Airport, which was deemed too small and impossible to expand due to space constraints. The new project had a much larger area to work with and generated a greatly needed number of jobs, helping many families during the Great Depression.Â  Employing over 1000 workers, the airportâs construction was said to be one of Portlandâs most significant public works improvements during the New Deal era. It was not without its challenges, though: the airportâs low-lying area was highly susceptible to flooding due to its proximity to the Columbia River, which led to the workers having to cover the area with over 4 million cubic yards of sand to help drain the water, along with a series of dikes to keep flooding at bay. By 1941, two runways capable of handling larger commercial aircraft were ready, and it temporarily served as a military airfield for the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. A new terminal opened in 1959, still serving as the present facility, albeit heavily upgraded.Â  The terminal was first renovated in the 1980s, ensuring Portland was ready for future needs. Ticketing and baggage claim areas were expanded and renovated, and a new concourse was added in 1986. A full reconstruction of Concourse E in 1992 and the opening of Concourse D in 1994 followed. New concourses (A, B, and C) were inaugurated a day before 9/11, giving its present H-shape. Further terminal expansion was only carried out in the early 2020s (part of it was absent from iBlueYonderâs first rendition). Part of the new expansion work is still ongoing and scheduled to launch in late 2025, but the developer has already brought it to the virtual realm of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Itâs a hub for Alaska Airlines and served by Air Canada Express, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, British Airways, Condor, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Icelandair, JetBlue, KLM, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, Volaris, and WestJet Encore. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, a highly detailed terminal building with full interiors, custom jetways, many new buildings and garages, custom ground service equipment, and a custom GSX Pro profile. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $19.96, requiring at least 3.67 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>iniBuilds Announces London Gatwick Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inilgw"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67dde76ffe85203834ea32a1_lgw.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently announced the development of London Gatwick Airport (EGKK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the Greater London Urban Area and has a yearly average of 40.9 million passengers, making it the second busiest airport in London and the eighth busiest in Europe. â The airport was built in the mid-1950s on top of a preexisting military facility (RAF Gatwick), and its buildings were designed by Yorke Rosenberg Mardall.Â  â On the other hand, RAF Gatwick took over an aerodrome from the 1920s, which had been operating commercially since the 1930s after authorization from the Air Ministry. Its first terminal, the Beehive, was inaugurated in 1935.Â  â The 1990s saw huge upgrades to the airport due to British Airwaysâ decision to build Gatwick as their secondary hub upon acquiring Dan Air, which led to their significant dominance at the turn of the millennium. â Shortly after that, though, British Airways decided to de-hub the airport, which led to the growth of a popular low-cost carrier, easyJet. â Itâs a British Airways hub and an operating base for BA Euro Flyer, easyJet UK, Norse Atlantic UK, TUI Airways, Vueling, and Wizz Air UK. Aegean Airlines, Air China, Air Europa, Air India, Air Transat, airBaltic, Atlantic Airways, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Corendon, Croatia Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airways, Emirates, Ethiopian, Freebird Airlines, Gulf Air, Iberia Express, Icelandair, ITA, JetBlue, Kenya Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Nouvelair, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Ryanair, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, SunExpress, Swiss, TAP Air Portugal, TUI Airways, Turkish Airlines, Volotea, Vueling, and WestJet also serve it. â Thereâs no information on pricing or release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!
