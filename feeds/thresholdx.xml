    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft and ToLiss have announced a new partnership at this year's FlightSimExpo, confirming development of an Airbus A340-600 for MSFS. The upcoming release will mark ToLissâ first entry into the MSFS platform, having already built a reputation for high-fidelity Airbus aircraft in X-Plane. In a statement published on Facebook, ToLiss said the aircraft will feature their proprietary systems suite adapted from X-Plane. It will also include a custom-built flight model, designed specifically for MSFS.  The aircraft is being jointly developed, with Aerosoft handling modelling and visual assets, and ToLiss the flight and systems modelling. While no release timeline has been shared, a recently published video on the Aerosoft Flight YouTube channel showcases the A340 handling three different technical scenarios, including an engine failure after takeoff, and sections of an RNAV approach.Â  A standout feature is a seemingly working taxi camera, rarely seen in MSFS due to simulator limitations. ToLiss has long been recognised in the X-Plane community for its attention to detail and system accuracy, notably in the A319, A321, A340 and A330neo series. Their upcoming A340-600 for MSFS aims to bring the same level of depth to a new audience. â Further details on the project, including pricing and release platforms, are expected as development continues. â Be sure to follow Threshold for the latest updates! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released its rendition of Western Sydney International Airport (YSWS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport is situated approximately 38 miles from the center of Sydney and is currently under construction, with a projected completion date at the end of 2026. Once finished, it will serve as a supplement to the existing Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (YSSY). Construction of the new Western Sydney International Airport began in 2018 and is expected to be completed by late 2026. This airport will be notable for using a remote and virtual control tower rather than the traditional air traffic control tower, making it the first airport in Australia to feature this technology. The new airport is being built to supplement the existing Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (YSSY), which has limited space for expansion. As of now, airlines including Qantas, Jetstar, and Singapore Airlines have announced plans to operate flights to the new airport. The new scenery includes an up-to-date and high-quality model of the airport, advanced night lighting, custom jetways, and many additional features. The newly released Western Sydney International Airport is now available from SimMarket for approximately $23.44. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations recently shared a batch of Aerostar 600 screenshots provided by their beta testers. These screenshots showcase many aspects of the 3D model, cockpit features, and feature-rich electronic flight bag. A few days ago, A2A finally announced a release date for the Aerostar, albeit in an early access program, allowing the community to experience the airplane as it undergoes its final polishing processes.Â  While not much was shared regarding features or images, the developers have now satiated everyoneâs curiosity with a substantial batch of screenshots, showcasing its internals and externals under different weather and lighting conditions and multiple hints on features.Â  The airplaneâs autopilot is a custom-simulated two-axis Century IV from the late 1970s, not relying on MSFSâs default systems. Furthermore, the EFB â despite looking similar â was fully rewritten and works as a native MSFS 2024 app, meaning it can also display other MSFS 2024 apps such as their flight planner, charts, SimBrief, Navigraph, and so on. Like their Comanche 250, the Aerostar will be compatible with multiple GPS options, including the PMS GTN750, the TDS GTN750Xi, and the KLN90B. Additionally, they have simulated two digital engine monitors this time: the JPI EDM 790 and the EDM 760.Â  Thereâs no pricing or a date for the release yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. DominicDesignTeam has recently released their rendition of Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport (KAMA) for X-Plane 12, serving the city of Amarillo, Texas, with a yearly average of 802,000 passengers. The airport was built in the early 1940s as a United States Army AirfieldâAmarillo Fieldâwith the sole purpose of training Flying Fortress mechanics and technicians. Instruction work started as soon as the construction was completed in September 1942. Armadillo sat dormant for a few years until the war in Korea prompted them once again to use the airfield as a training base, which became Amarillo Air Force Base. Its AFB life continued until 1968. American Airlines (albeit seasonally), American Eagle, Southwest Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 3D vegetation, custom night lighting, custom vehicles, customized ground structure, custom 3D models, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.54, requiring at least 1.11 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has released their Accu-Sim Aerostar 600 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in Early Access. It's the company's first fully native aircraft for the new platform, taking full advantage of its features, performance enhancements, and visual capabilities. It enters early access in a late beta stage, with most of its systems and features already in place, only requiring a bit of further polishing as they move toward the full release.Â  The Aerostar 600 was designed and built by Ted Smith Aircraft Company in the late 1960s, with speed, sleekness, and power in mind. It was the fastest twin-piston general aviation aircraft during its heyday. Powered by two Lycoming IO-540-K engines, each producing 290 horsepower, it can cruise at 408 km/h, with a service ceiling of 25,000ft and 1,500 nautical miles of range on a single tank. Like their Comanche 250, it is built on their proprietary Accu-Sim 2.0 technology, bringing an advanced aerodynamic system that faithfully represents how the airplane's surfaces interact with the air, along with realistic simulation of wear and tear on the airframe and engine, an in-depth electrical simulation, and much more.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has recently published a new development update on their upcoming Fokker 70/100 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, showcasing their advancements on what allegedly pushes the boundaries of what their products can deliver. The developers take us on a test flight from Salzburg to Brussels using the latest beta version of their Fokker 100 Professional. They highlight that it is still very much a work in progress, with bugs and unfinished elements to be expected (and pointed out along the way). They start by showcasing the flight deck with its sweet mixture of CRT displays and analogue gauges from the beginning of the âglass cockpitâ era. The texturing was made using reference imagery of the real aircraft, and it also includes customizable elements such as different taxi light configurations and multiple panel and instrument configurations across the F70 and 100. â The externals have also been based on real imagery, with hand-placed rivets, screws, and panels.Â  â Just Flight has also paid special attention to the cabin, bringing a meticulous craft of the Fokker 100âs different passenger cabin configurations, with internal and external cargo and passenger door options, changing per livery configuration. The work on the cabin is mostly complete, with the only remaining things being fine-tuning the lighting and integrating specific cabin-to-cockpit interactions. â They have been focusing a lot on performance optimization, achieving FPS figures within 5% of the default 747 and 787 in MSFS 2020 with their latest F100 beta build. Just Flight reinforces that FPS figures will vary from machine to machine, scenery to scenery, and so on. They will encourage content creators to show performance figures once they are given access to the product for their reviews. The interactive checklists were included in full, housing over 300 items, 250 of which you are supposed to check before take-off, albeit most of them are only checked during the first flight of the day after a cold and dark startup. From all the tests and stuff, they have yet to complete the annunciator test, which involves a very specific, ordered illumination of all the cockpit annunciators. They captured a slow-motion video of this test from a real Fokker, allowing them to replicate it with maximum accuracy. Their FMS (Flight Management System) is custom-coded from scratch, including features such as IRS alignment (real-time and fast align), manual IRS alignment adjustment, manual flight plan entry, automatic and manual navaid tuning, navigation and performance monitoring, custom waypoint creation, and vertical navigation. They will dive deeper into the FMS in their upcoming marketing content and operations manual. The FMS on both the F70 and F100 is said to be the most complex system they have developed so far, as itâs the heart of the aircraft, interacting with the autopilot, flight model, EFIS displays, and other systems. This complexity takes time to develop and has been the most time-consuming part so far, but they consider it feature-complete as of now.Â  Based on recent testing, Just Flight claims their F70/F100 add-on is within 95% of real-world data, sometimes even reaching 100% accuracy in certain phases of the climb profile. The accuracy will continue to improve as the company further develops the product. Their Fokker 100 is already able to perform a successful autoland, although they have to be âextra vigilantâ due to the beta nature of their aircraft.Â  There is no pricing or release date information yet, but Just Flight plans to share more information soon. They are very proud of how far they have come with their most ambitious project yet in terms of sheer complexity.

The update showcases the artwork on the now fully complete flight deck based on a real airframe (F-WUAB). The flight deck will be highly configurable, with multiple possible configurations toggleable via EFB or variant-dependent. While they are currently focusing on recreating the A300B4-203 variant fitted with an INS, they will also offer the option to use the UNS-1 FMS and TCAS VSI. A full list of all the possible configurations will be shared prior to the release. The passenger cabin is nearing completion, with over 200 seats and an interior design that screams 1980s. Itâs said to perfectly capture the era, except for the cigarette smoke (which they jokingly considered adding to the feature request list). A dedicated feature update on their cabin progress is coming soon. Furthermore, Just Flight can finally share external shots of the A300 for the first time in the new platform (as it was initially intended for P3D). Upon platform transition, they decided to start nearly from scratch to meet MSFSâs visual standards. â The work on the exterior modeling is said to be 95% complete, and the only things remaining are the second engine variant and the wing flex. Every rivet, screw, fastener, panel line, weathered surface, and text decal was carefully hand placed on the exterior, ensuring maximum accuracy. Itâs a massive undertaking for an airplane this big. Their development team has recently revisited the real aircraft to gather more high-resolution images, filling specific gaps in their photograph collection and allowing them to detect certain discrepancies in previously textured areas, which have since been corrected. Systems-wise, they have now integrated the systems code into their MSFS version of the aircraft, meaning it is now âaliveâ in the simulator, and their internal testing team can start evaluating it. The systems integration happened later in the development stage because most was already complete due to their original P3D development effort, meaning their first MSFS build already features a highly advanced systems suite. â The aircraftâs core systems are said to be fully custom-coded, aiming to achieve maximum fidelity. They exemplify the depth by mentioning how the A300 has 10 fuel pumps â two in each fuel tank âand the fuel pressure supplied by each pump is slightly different, varying every time you load into the aircraft, replicating what youâd see in the real aircraft. â Systems-wise, most of what is still being worked on is navigation-related, such as the autopilot and the INS. Work is progressing well, though, and they will share more information on those soon in future development updates. â There is still no release date or pricing information, but Threshold will keep you informed as development progresses.

    <title>Taimodels Releases QuÃ©bec City International Airport for X-Plane 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels recently released their rendition of QuÃ©bec City Jean Lesage International Airport (CYQB) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the QuÃ©bec City metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 1.7 million passengers. It was established in 1939 as a military training facility for air observers, with the first flight only taking place two years later, on September 11, 1941. It was then known as RCAF Station LâAncienne-Lorette, and its wartime foundation laid the essential infrastructure (runways, hangars, and control tower) that would eventually be adapted for civil use. Its transition from military to civil use happened when World War 2 ended, with the Department of Transport taking over immediately. Early commercial flights connected QuÃ©bec to other major Canadian cities, fostering economic growth in the region. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased passenger numbers as air travel became more popular, requiring expansion work to accommodate the ever-growing number of people. Furthermore, the beginning of the jet age also demanded slightly longer jetways and aprons. In 2006, the administration invested over 65 million dollars in increasing the terminalâs passenger handling capacity and improving the overall quality of their services. The modernization included a terminal reconfiguration, the enlargement of waiting rooms, and the complete restructuring of the baggage handling area. The process was finished 2 years later, and the airport could now handle up to 1.4 million passengers. It was expanded again in 2011âat a cost of over 200 million dollarsâdoubling the terminalâs size. The project took 6 years to complete and also included a new runway, new taxiways, new deicing pads, and enhanced facilities. â Two years after the conclusion of the terminal expansion, further work was carried out to link the domestic and international terminals. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality models, custom ground markings, custom autogen around the airportâs area, performance-friendly optimization, and X-Plane 12âs weather textures. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.49, requiring at least 931.19 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdg713"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/670074421902159c8c578804_randy5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update concerning their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 and provided a concrete release date for its upcoming 777LR.Â  While PMDG was originally planning to push out a series of 777 updates a bit before FSExpo, they claim to have underestimated the amount of work required to prepare for it, ultimately deciding to hold off on pushing the updates until the dust was settled for good, in case something went wrong with the update. â They anticipate Microsoft will push out the 777 lineup update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 sometime next week (777-300ER and 777F only), bringing it up to build 116. Itâs mostly a cleanup update, with no new features per se. The same timeframe applies to the update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 users, which will become free for 2020 version owners. â Â  The 777-200ER, on the other hand, is having issues with Microsoftâs intake process, and itâs unknown whether it will be available next week alongside the other family members.Â  â Build 166 will also be available for PMDG.com customers on Tuesday, marking the first time since the airplanes were released that there is version parity between the marketplace and their own storefront.Â  â The upcoming 777-200LR is undergoing its final testing phase and is scheduled to be released on July 15th. FSExpo has significantly delayed their progress, though, so it might be pushed to the following week. As usual, it will be made available on the website first and then in the marketplace within two weeks, assuming the intake process goes well. â Furthermore, PMDG has publicly addressed some of the questions they heard at FSExpo, where they held their booth for the first time despite being a long-term major sponsor. Along these questions, the 737NG is said to be coming âasapâ to 2024, the 737Max could be coming soon, and PMDG might work on a 787.Â  â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently updated their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing new features, bug fixes, immersive visual improvements, and more. Update v1.1.1 brings the long-awaited Collimated HUD, delivering accurate projection and dynamics right in your eye line, improving situational awareness in any weather. They have also addressed community feedback on the MFDs not being clickable in VR. iniBuilds says this is related to how mouse interaction checks occur per screen, which sometimes fail in VR frame updates. They are still investigating it. Furthermore, some users noted that both cursors disappear when a text box is active, whereas that does not happen IRL. It was a design choice to avoid mouse input conflicts. â The Hydraulic system logic has been fully overhauled, correcting an issue where the outer flaps wouldnât extend when the hydraulics were lost, despite the SD page showing they should. The logic has been reworked and now operates as required. â They also addressed community feedback on the ECAM memo formatting, which they claim to be accurate and based on a realistic MSN configuration and software version they had verified access to. â The visual department has seen tweaks, improving the engine blur with more transitional texture stages for a smoother animation. The metal rendering has also been enhanced, elevating the realism. 2024 users also got improved advanced weathering effects, with dents, taped areas on wings, and more. The window blinds are now visible from the outside. After months of testing, the A350 is a week away from making its debut on Xbox (MSFS 2024 only). It will include the recently released ULR variant but wonât feature the HUD yet (but itâs well underway). The 2020 version is still undergoing testing. The complete changelog for the update follows below: Systems â FIXED: GA phase stuck in engine-out condition in some casesÂ Â  FIXED: Derotation law now correctly disengages during go-aroundÂ Â
