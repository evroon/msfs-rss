    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has just released an update for Mega Airport Frankfurt for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. While the changelog is brief, this update introduces optimisations that significantly decrease VRAM usage and enhance overall performance. The latest update introduces optimisations for all models, textures, LOD settings, and more. This has allowed for a reduction in VRAM usage of up to 1.6 GB, though most users can expect a slightly smaller decrease. Some users reported performance drops when facing Terminal 2. This issue was caused by the large forest north of the terminal, but it has now been resolved. The team has noted a bug with blurry textures in the scenery, and they are currently working on a patch that is expected to be released by early next week. The updated version of Mega Airport Frankfurt is now available at Aerosoft on sale for $18.41. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has via Discord released an official development update for its 737 MAX product, outlining planned features for the Service Pack 1 update, as well as its plans for the MSFS 2024 platform. The team made it clear that the SP1 content is still in active development, and that the update will not be released within the next three months. Amongst the changes in SP1 are a more âtablet-styleâ electronic flight bag (EFB), rather than the current Boeing OEM unit, accompanied by CPDLC integration via the Hoppie API, with support for online networks, as well as BATC and SayIntentions, also under review. Other planned features include cabin announcements (with and without GSX), the MAX 8-200 variant, with the typeâs Mid-Cabin Emergency Doors modelled, a visual APU model, an expanded main wheel well model, and an updated fuselage model, rivets and other details.  Cabin materials will be redrawn with more texture detail, multiple seating layouts will be offered, and cockpit materials will be refined for better surface type distinction. Landing gear textures will be overhauled, LNAV behaviour will see targeted adjustments, and numerous smaller fixes will be implemented before release. The update also marks a shift in development priorities. SP1 will be the final major release to support MSFS 2020, with all future development moving to MSFS 2024, due to substantial platform differences between the two. Post-SP1 plans include a native MSFS 2024 version of the MAX 9, with the MAX 10 and MAX 7 also under consideration, only after official certification and service entry of those types. While small patches may still arrive for the current MAX 8 for 2020 after SP1, iFlyâs primary focus will be advancing the series for the newer simulator. You can read the full development update on iFly's official Discord server.  For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has shared an update of its highly anticipated HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update was posted on its community forum earlier this week. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, this is the third and final planned preview before release. The previews highlight the Delta TechOps area and the airportâs control tower, amongst others. Delta TechOps, also known as Delta TOC, is the largest airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in North America, and has been recreated in the scenery, with 1:1 accuracy. Veneziani stated that âevery pipe, air-conditioning unit, and rooftop elementâ was individually modelled, based on real-world references. While the developer showcased the maintenance complex, he noted that the airside portion of the airport is not yet ready for display, as the ground polygon is still in progress. Remaining work includes cargo buildings on both the north and south sides, taxiway signage, approach lighting, and tunnel detailing, as well as general finishing touches. According to Veneziani, the goal is to release the scenery before Christmas. He noted that development has been underway for nearly two years, with a continued emphasis on quality over timelines. HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport is the worldâs busiest by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, serving as Delta Air Linesâ primary hub. We'll keep you updated on its release. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Microsoft Releases Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/m24su3"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the highly anticipated Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024, marking one of the biggest updates to the simulator since launch. It brings performance fixes, weather and world upgrades, aircraft, traffic, and ATC changes, airport improvements, SDK updates, and broad adjustments to core systems, and career mode. Labelled version 1.5.27.0, SU3 brings wide-ranging changes, including the highly requested ability to locally download content from the MSFS Library. This allows more control over content management, with simulator files being able to be stored locally on a userâs system, rather than relying solely on cloud-based streaming and internet downloads. Fixes to weather include an issue where the correct METAR data was not always honoured at airports; furthermore, lightning in storms is now far less excessive, thunderstorm prediction is better, and cloud transitions on the world map are smoother. Distant cloud lighting has been improved, photogrammetry tile popping is reduced, and map camera zooming has been corrected. Streaming reliability should be better, including fixes for freezes caused by mislabelled sound folders. AI and live traffic now flow more smoothly, with fewer overshoots, ârear-end incidentsâ, and stuck vehicles. Taxi speeds have been tuned, parked aircraft distribution rebalanced, and model-matching now prefers AI-optimised assets. Contrails rendering has been improved, gear animations have been corrected, livery depiction improved, and generic placeholder aircraft have been phased out. Aircraft across the default fleet have received updates, with refinements to Garmin avionics and autopilot systems. The Boeing 787, 747, and Airbus A320neo have seen flight dynamics and stability tweaks, while the Cessna 172 and Daher TBM 930 have received various bug fixes and performance improvements. Significant performance and stability upgrades have also been introduced. Sim Update 3 includes better memory management, improved CPU and GPU balancing, and reduced stuttering, during heavy scenery loading. Smoother framerates should be noticable in high-density areas, such as large international airports, and photogrammetry-heavy cities.Â  Some of the addressed issues include Xbox boot crashes when many packages are installed, several rare parser and stallâwarning crashes, VR in/out switching, airportârendering freezes, and texture handling that could corrupt WASM gauges, on Series S, or lowâtexture settings on PC. Menu caching in Controls now reduces unnecessary file I/O, and avatar thumbnails are generated faster. DLSS MultiâFrame Generation options have been corrected, and multiple content management edge cases have been cleaned up, in order to prevent profile or content conflicts. Sim Update 3 is available now on all platforms, as a free download for all MSFS 2024 users. Full patch notes can be found on the official Microsoft Flight Simulator website, and the MSFS forums.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has just released the Eurocopter EC 135 for free, alongside Sim Update 3, which was also released earlier today.Â  The Eurocopter EC135 is an advanced light twin-engine utility helicopter that can seat up to eight passengers, produced by Airbus Helicopters, previously named Eurocopter. This is Microsoftâs 21st âLocal Legendâ, and is the last of the four free aircraft promised by Microsoft to make up for MSFS 2024âs launch problems.Â  The Eurocopter has a rich history, originating from a collaboration between Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm (MBB) and Aerospatiale in the 1970s. The EC 135 introduced innovative technologies such as full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) for helicopters and a hingeless main rotor. The company that developed the EC 135 has undergone significant changes over the years. Originally known as MBB, it was acquired by Daimler-Benz and subsequently merged into DASA. In 1992, DASA joined forces with Aerospatiale to become Eurocopter, which was later rebranded as Airbus Helicopters in 2014. Because of the 2014 rebranding, what was previously the Eurocopter EC 135 is today branded as the Airbus Helicopters H135. The Eurocopter EC 135 is now available for free in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Togstad Simulation Products has just launched its version of RÃ¸rvik Airport (ENRM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Situated in TrÃ¸ndelag county, approximately 3 nautical miles from the town of RÃ¸rvik, this small public airport facilitates flights to and from Trondheim and Namsos, operated by the airline WiderÃ¸e. After opening in 1986, the airport's initial service was provided by the airline Norving, which operated the Dornier 228. However, Norving announced the termination of its services in 1988, leaving the airport without any scheduled flights. That same year, WiderÃ¸e began operating flights to and from the airport. Today, WiderÃ¸e remains the only airline with scheduled services available. It operates its Dash 8-100 and Dash 8-200 aircraft on routes to both Trondheim and Namsos, bringing nearly 40,000 passengers to the airport each year. The newly released RÃ¸rvik Airport scenery includes custom buildings, 3D models, detailed interiors, custom runway lights, taxiway lights, and much more. The newly released RÃ¸rvik Airport from Togstad Simulation Products is now available through Orbx for approximately $12.83. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
