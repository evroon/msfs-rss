    <title>RW Profiles Releases Springfield-Branson National Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RW Profiles has recently released their rendition of Springfield-Branson National Airport (KSGF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Springfield and Branson in Missouri with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers as of 2023. It opened as Springfield-Greene County Airport in July 1945, replacing their former - much smaller - main airport.Â  American Airlines started scheduled service to the newly built airport in that same year, only pulling out in 1963. Chicago and Southern landed in 1948, and Ozark in 1951. Ozark was also responsible for the airportâs first scheduled jet service with their brand-new DC-9s in 1966.Â  The airportâs current name was adopted in 1992 as the administration attempted to capitalize on Bransonâs ever-growing tourist industry (even though itâs around 80 km away).Â  In May 2006, construction work started on a new terminal, inaugurated three years later, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills.Â  Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, United Express, DHL, FedEx Express, and UPS Airlines serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, accurate night lighting, aÂ custom runway, highly detailed models, up-to-date airport layout, LOD optimization, and an official GSX profile. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.24, requiring at least 2.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Exclusive Closed Alpha and Public Beta Announced for FlightFactorâs 777v2 Release: Invitations Rolling Out </title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor has recently published a statement on their social network pages with their final decision on the release policy of their upcoming Boeing 777 v2 for X-Plane, including an exclusive non-public alpha program and a public beta later down the line. A previous statement made by Ramzzess on X-Plane.Org Forums stirred quite a bit of drama from the community as it mentioned their ponderation of a beta release without any vertical guidance at all, which led to a poll and their decision to feature a non-public alpha program first, where a select few would be chosen to purchase and test the product after signing a non-disclosure agreement.Â  Later, a public beta will roll out with all the major features (except CPDLC). Therefore, once that is out, the public beta testers will not have to experience the 777 without a working VNAV. Invitations for the closed alpha have been rolling out since yesterday (23/04). The purchased keys will be permanent and grant access to future updates. They also made sure to highlight that there are no applications for the closed alpha, and invitees will be chosen by themselves. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Brazil Land Games Previews BrasÃ­lia International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/bsb244"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has shared more previews of their upcoming BrasÃ­lia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more. It was divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, terminal interiors, custom jetways with detailed interior, detailed landside, and more. Thereâs no release date yet, but itâs said to be coming soon. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight recently released their rendition of the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This two-seat fixed tricycle gear general aviation plane was designed for flight training, touring, and personal use. Introduced in 1978, the Tomahawk was designed from the get-go to be an affordable trainer aircraft with flight characteristics that would allow instructors to push the envelope a little further in comparison with the Cessna 152, which was the de facto trainer aircraft at the time: unlike its rival, the PA-38 would require specific pilot input to recover from spins. Nearly 2,500 units were produced during its relatively short production lifespan from 1978 to 1982.Â  Powered by a 112 hp Avco Lycoming O-235-L2C, the PA-38 can cruise at 185 km/h with a maximum range of 867 km and a service ceiling of 13,000ft.Â  Itâs still widely used for pilot training in many countries worldwide, reflected in the add-on with its considerable set of liveries. Other than the liveries, Just Flightâs rendition offers an accurately modeled rendition of the aircraft, with PBR materials, custom ground equipment, 8K textures, a truly tridimensional virtual cockpit, realistic wear and tear, an EFB for controlling various aircraft options, and more. The complete feature list follows below: â The add-on is available onÂ Just Flightâs websiteÂ for $41.99, requiring at least 1.6 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Sky-Additions has recently released their rendition of Paris-Vatry Airport (LFOK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It serves the champagne region in Northeastern France and is close enough to Paris (135km) to be considered by Ryanair as one of the Parisian airports. As of 2018, the airport had a yearly average of 61,826 passengers. It was built as an air base in 1953, housing fifty fighters in three large hangars. When France withdrew from the integrated NATO structure in 1967, the Americans left the base, leading to its closure. The French Air Force then used it for training until the early 2000s, when it was sold to civil interests and converted into a civilian airport. Besides handling occasional passenger traffic, itâs also a training pilot site for many airlines, such as Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, KLM, Transavia, Transavia France, and Swiss. Airbus has also used its relatively long runway for aircraft testing. Itâs served by Ryanair, with flights to Marrakech and Porto.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, a custom GSX profile, detailed environmental elements, realistic airport vehicles, custom ground markings, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.64, requiring at least 120.97 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Threshold recently received exclusive screenshots of the upcoming Kola Map for DCS, and today, we have three more exclusives to share with you. The community has highly anticipated the new Kola Map, which will cover large parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. As of now, the project is listed as "coming soon," with the release of the early access version imminent. The Kola Map will first be available for early access and will be feature-packed with a multitude of airports. There will be two airports in Finland, five in Russia, two in Norway, and three in Sweden. Additionally, early access ensures a complete base terrain, highly detailed topography for the entire map, and lots of POIs, road and railroad networks, night lighting, and many landmarks to explore. Although early access will be available first, many future features have already been planned. Winter textures are scheduled to ensure the representation of the cold and harsh climate up North. A multitude of military airfields like Bardufoss and Kirkenes and a variety of civilian airports, including TromsÃ¸ and LuleÃ¥, are also planned. Also, general improvements to landscape features have been scheduled. The official store page for the Kola Map is now available on Orbx. Be sure to check it out for more information and screenshots. â We will update you with more information as soon as it becomes available. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
