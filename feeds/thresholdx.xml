    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 has just released its latest product for MSFS. This time itâs Aberdeen Airport (EGPD). With a yearly average of just over 1.9 million passengers, the Scottish airport serves the city of Aberdeen. Located in the Dyce suburb of Aberdeen, Scotland, the international airport opened back in 1934. The airport started as Dyce Aerodrome, before becoming a Royal Air Force station during the Second World War. After the war, the airport slowly became the international airport it is today. Located around 9.3 km (roughly 5.8 mi) from the city center, the airport is a focus city for airlines like Eastern Airways, Loganair, and TUI Airways. Although the airport was ranked worst in Scotland in 2019, it made a comeback in 2022, being named Scottish Airport of the Year. The airport has a multitude of destinations, ranging from chilly Norway to sunny Spain. The scenery has a variety of features included, some of them being Full Detail Buildings, Realistic Ground Markings, Hi Res Ground Images, Stunning Night Effects, High Detail Airport Vehicles, Fencing, vegetation and PBR Materials. The scenery package also includes an optional feature of Static Aircraft. Aberdeen Airport is now available on SimMarket for $17.30USD. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <title>JustFlight Announces BAe 146 V2 Update</title>
    <updated>2024-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfbae2"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66056d4e069cd4c2780e8f0c_Screenshot%202024-03-28%20083822.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. JustFlight has announced a new update for BAe 146 Professional for MSFS on social media. This update will be free of charge for all customers on both PC and Xbox. The update will be available on the 1st of April. This update will bring users the highly-requested UNS-1. The FMS will feature a unique interface of the real unit along with the holding pattern, direct to, and command heading functions, TOD calculations based on target VS, navigation monitoring, real-time performance information, support for SID and STAR, as well as the ability to import and export flight plans.  An in-depth manual for UNS-1 that contains all its features will be provided with the update.  The WT ProLine 21 that was included in v1 will still be available in the new update, and the two types of the FMS can be changed in the EFB. A brand new, high-detailed passenger cabin will also be present in v2. Each version of BAe146 will receive a new cabin design, followed by fully interactive FWD and AFT galleys (yes, the coffee maker is functional!), cabin lighting controls, cabin calls, and ground service electrical supplier simulation. Another interesting feature is a music player - it comes with 7 music tracks that can be controlled by the user. Players will be able to import their custom music through the cabin speakers. A new boarding simulation will be added in the update. The EFB will now feature several different boarding/deboarding speeds, ranging from instant to realistic. For instance, boarding a fully loaded BAe 146-300 could take up to 20 minutes! During boarding, you can hear new passenger boarding sounds. GSX profiles for each variant will be included. Another highly-requested feature is a paper clipboard instead of the modern EFB. Unfortunately, it will take some time to convert all the functions of EFB to the clipboard, but JF has announced that they have started working on that. This update will feature something rustic though, as pilots will be able to use a paper checklist on the yoke, which can have up to 15 pages, and the paper charts that are stored in the charts holder will hover over the top pedestal after being clicked on. Up to 20 charts can be stored, and custom checklists and charts can be imported by placing PNG images in the necessary folder. The new update will also feature three new default liveries for the -200 and -300 variants. The -200 variant will receive a Discovery Air livery (US Honolulu-based airline), while the -300 will receive United Express Battleship Gray and buzz liveries (not to be confused with Buzz - Ryanair subsidiary) A plethora of new features are in the v2 update, some of them being: an updated flight model for better ground handling, improved AP altitude capture, improved cabin door and airstair animation, as well as new wiper animations. The full changelog can be found here. Updated BAe 146 Operation Manual, EFB manual, and UNS-1 manual are provided with the newest update. How do you like the newest update? Is there anything new you would like to see in the future on BAe 146 Professional? Let us know in the comments! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Releases London Luton Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/iniggw"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6606f1e13e5286d1e071ebf1_luton1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of London Luton Airport (EGGW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Greater London, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, and Cambridgeshire with a yearly average of 13.3 million passengers, making it the fifth busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Opened in 1938, Luton was of great importance to the Royal Air Force during World War 2, with commercial activities only resuming seven years after the conflict. Luton was pivotal to developing the package holiday business in the UK, amounting to a fifth of all holiday flights in the United Kingdom by 1969, leading to a major expansion plan in the subsequent decade to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic figures. Fate might have been a bit cruel to Luton, as the figures dipped massively in the 1980s, leading to the addition of âLondonâ to its name to emphasize its proximity to the capital. While the extra traffic did, in fact, come during the 1990s, it was in no way due to the renaming strategy, but by embracing charter operators and low-cost carriers such as Debonair and easyJet, which transformed it into the fastest growing major airport in the country. The rapid growth was rewarded with an 80 million pound investment program, which improved its infrastructure and facilities. It was followed by the construction of a 40 million pound terminal in 1999, opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip, housing 60 check-in desks and a range of commercial outlets. Six years later, the departure and arrival lounges were redeveloped at the cost of 38 million pounds. â Further development was conducted in 2018 at the cost of 160 million pounds, including new shops, a new boarding pier, and more boarding gates, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 18 million a year. Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air UK, which, aside from Dan Air, El Al, FlyOne, and SunExpress, are the only ones that serve the airport, making it a full LCC-centric hub. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, high-detail models of all airport buildings and objects, an up-to-date layout, an official GSX profile, LOD optimization, custom static aircraft, and more. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $17.91, requiring at least 5.31 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Jokeless April Fools Day Development Update</title>
    <updated>2024-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777041"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/660b6a529653d007ea9eda3d_777new.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has published a new development update with information on a recent 737 update, two new 77W teasers, and more.Â  Allegedly too busy with their upcoming products to be "funny," they have skipped on this year's April Fools shenanigans, as they didn't want to play with people's feelings by pretending to delay a product release or something of the sort and anything more intricate than that would take time and effort. "The key to a good joke is knowing when not to play a good joke," concluded Randazzo.Â  â The first topic to be brought up is their 737 lineup update, currently under a critical fixes-only development status, given the work on the upcoming 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The latest update (3.00.0092) addresses the fact they accidentally pushed an earlier build instead of the real 3.00.0091, which had stability issues and features that were not quite complete, in Randazzo's own words.Â  The new update should bring it up to parity with the correct build, and it should be out to marketplace users this Friday or around April 11 at the latest. They also apologize for the inconvenience and are still unsure how they managed such a feat.Â  777-wise, Randazzo has shared two images of the long-awaited airline with the PMDG house livery. They have started to add wear and tear to the cockpit, and previews will be shared eventually.Â  Unlike their 737NG, which was a brand new airframe when they conducted their survey, the 777 they based their flight deck on is 12 years old, which they plan on realistically conveying with their texturing. The 747-400, on the other hand, will reflect a heavily used airplane, as their real research counterpart did. They have been working on implementing new features that Randazzo has not yet been allowed to share. Still, he hinted at multiple tablet features, greater sound integration, improved maintenance processes, and more. Robert concludes with great enthusiasm about its imminent release, saying it's very close to being in everyone's hangars and that it might as well be their best release yet. The PMDG 737 lineup is available in theirÂ store, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $69.99. The upcoming 777-300ER's pricing and release date are yet to be revealed.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Works, a freeware development group known for mods for default A330 in X-Plane 12 announced on April 1st that they are developing A380 for X-Plane. Many were puzzled if this was just a joke or a real project, so we decided to investigate a bitâ¦ â A short conversation with the main developer of this project solved this interesting April Foolsâ enigma. We are glad to announce that the X-Works A380 mod is indeed - a real project! â Bru_aviationspotter, one of two main developers in this project was kind enough to answer some of our questions, and provide us with more previews of A380! â What is your estimation for the release date? âWe have come a long way with the exterior model but we certainly have a long way ahead so donât expect it to be released in the near future. Looking at other developers a plane is not made within a few months or a year but because itâs a complicated plane and my first time that I make a plane from scratch this will take longer.â How far has the plane progressed? âI made a little progress chart where you can see what has been done and what needs to happen or how far we are in working on that part of the plane.â What inspired you to start this project? âI wanted an A380 in XP for a long time, and when I realised that no other developer wanted to work on it, I decided to make it myself.â â As you can see in the screenshots, the fuselage is nearly done, and developers are currently in the modelling phase, working on the landing gear to be precise. We wish X-Works success in further developing! As always, Threshold will keep you updated with the progress of A380. â What do you think about this project? Are you excited about it?

    <title>Axonos Announces Richmond International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ricaxo"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/660eaad9ee08b24d3635dec4_ric1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Axonos has recently announced the development and imminent release of Richmond International Airport (KRIC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Sandston, Virginia, with a yearly average of 4.7 million passengers, making it the busiest in Central Virginia and third-busiest in the state, only behind Washington Reagan and Washington Dulles. Its history dates back to 1927 when it was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field in honor of Richard E. Byrd, brother of the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.Â  A terminal building was built in 1950, designed by Marcellus Wright and Son. Expansion work, including the current passenger concourses, was conducted between 1968 and 1970. The early 2000s saw impressive growth figures, leading to a complete redesign of the terminal, which added ten gates, extra parking spaces, and a new air control tower. It also included a complete revamp of the terminal building and the construction of a central utility plant. The two-year project was concluded in 2007. It was expanded again in 2018, two years after it recorded its second highest yearly passenger volume, with the gate count going from 22 to 30. It was concluded three years later, in 2021.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. April Fools' Day was a few days ago, and it's a day of jokes and giggles where developers break out of their professional skin and come up with something funny for the community to enjoy. It's a day of tradition, and every year we get something fun to laugh about. Now that weâve given enough time for the jokes to go through the system, let's recap what April Fools' Day has brought the flight simming community in 2024. IniBuilds has released the iniR24 for MSFS, a state-of-the-art Formula 1 car that can be driven around the Yas Marina Circuit. Flight simming has now turned into a racing sim, so put on your gloves and get out on track with the new iniR24. Aeroplane Heaven has announced the A/47/10 THUNDERWARTHOG, a new and interesting plane for MSFS. Although we don't have many details about it, the plane has two turboprop engines at the back, and we can't wait to soar the virtual skies with it. Parallel 42 has released the ChasePlane Professional 4K HDR for MSFS, a convincing store page with many features like custom views, cinematics, turbulence effects, and more. However, the Buy Now button reveals the truth that ChasePlane for MSFS is not yet released, and they are dependent on Microsoft to change some things before it can become a reality. FSNews has announced FSNews Australia, a new website that is friendly to Aussies and the rest of the world. The whole website is turned upside down, and it's time for Australia to log on and finally enjoy it just like the rest of the world has done for a while. FlyJSim has announced the "Too Real" update for their upcoming 727 and 732 for X-Plane 12, which includes features like Door Plug Roulette, Maintenance Mayhem, and Random Flat Tires to push the boundaries of realism in flight simming. Got Friends has released the Paddle Wheeler for MSFS, a new aquatic bike that makes it easier to explore the seas within MSFS. MK Studios has announced a drastic change in their scenery development, with new scientific data showing that customers prioritize interior over exterior within a scenery. Therefore, MK Studios has decided to no longer consider the exterior as crucial. Flight Simulator 2024's aircraft list has been announced on Facebook, including planes like the "Airsus A320neo V3" and the "Belong 717-200" for the Ultra version of the sim. SoFly has released Dinosaurs for MSFS, allowing users to experience different types of dinosaurs and race around a dino-themed rally course. Toliss has announced a new add-on for X-Plane, the Handley Page H.P.42, which boasts features such as detailed dead reckoning navigation, top-notch electro-mechanical systems, and custom sounds. Mango Studios has also announced a sound pack for the new Toliss Handley Page H.P.42. FlyByWire shows a fine-tuned wing flex system on their A380. The new system will show how the real A380 acquires lift due to the realism of the new fine-tuned system. We hope you enjoyed these April Foolsâ Day entries by the flight sim community.  â For the latest flight simulation news (and jokes), stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <title>FSoares Announces GaleÃ£o International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSoares has recently announced the development of Rio de Janeiro/GaleÃ£o International Airport (SBGL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the main airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a yearly average of 7.9 million passengers. â It was opened in 1952 on top of a pre-existing Brazilian Air Force base that ended up being utilized by international long-haulers, which were too heavy and too large for SBRJâs (Rioâs domestic airport) 1300m runway. With the ever-increasing international demand, they finally built a passenger terminal, which was progressively expanded until 1977. â A new terminal building was opened that year, with all the scheduled passenger traffic transferred there. Itâs still in use today as Terminal 1. â Terminal 1 was first renovated in 1991 in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit (held in 1992), with its annual capacity increased to 7.5 million passengers. Eight years later, Terminal 2 was opened, with 24 jetways and also being able to handle up to 7.5 million passengers yearly. â With the imminence of the World Cup and the Olympic Games, in 2014 and 2016, respectively, Infraero (the airportâs former manager) unveiled a $431 million upgrade and expansion plan for GaleÃ£o, including the renovation of Terminal 1, the completion of Terminal 2, and expanding the parking lots. The new concessionary later revised the plans and decided to include a new pier with 26 jetways, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2640 car parking spaces. The $400 million sum quickly jumped to $800 million instead. â AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, Azul, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Flybondi, Gol, Iberia, ITA Airways, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, KLM, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Latam Peru, Lufthansa, Paranair, Sky Airlines, TAP, United Airlines, and Voepass serve it. â Thereâs no information on features, pricing, or release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>arwasairl &amp; FSMuseum Showcase Progress on Boeing 747 Classicâs Flight Deck for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSMuseumâs 747 Classic, initially meant for Flight Simulator 2004, appears to be getting a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version instead, with a custom 3D flight deck modeled by arwasairl. The incomplete renders of the flight deck reflect a 747-200B with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7R4G2 engines, FFRATS, Triple autopilot, Dial gauges, US weights with metric temperatures, and a Kollsman altimeter. Other variants are planned, including dual autopilot, taped displays, corrected engine scales, etc., and will be developed after the current variant is fully completed.Â  The 747 Classic project was first announced in 2020, and had been in development for six years prior, featuring a fully featured FDE with realistic damping, control, stability, and mach effects, and fine-tuned according to Boeing and NASA documents for all phases of flight. The load station data is also directly from Boeing weight and balance documents, with exact locations for MAC, LEMAC, Cargo, PAX, fuel tanks, and landing gear (including suspension).Â  It also features an accurate simulation of the electrical and fuel systems, working in accordance with Boeing specifications with correct loads and transfer rates.Â  â However, itâs important to note that the feature list reflected the project for Flight Simulator 2004, meaning things could have changed since then.Â â Refer to FSMuseumâsÂ original threadÂ for further information on the project. Arwasairlâs cockpit previews are availableÂ here. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <title>V Pilot Designs Releases Cartagena Airport V2 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/vpikcg"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/660f8a153db79e2540008508_skcg1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. V Pilot Designs has recently released the upgraded version of their Rafael NuÃ±ez Airport (SKCG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Cartagena, Colombia, with a yearly average of 7.2 million passengers. It was built in 1946 as Crespo Air Field, with TACA Colombia being the first airline to serve the city, albeit very briefly, as they went under a year later, with LANSA taking the remaining slots. â By 1979, the airport averaged around 99 flights a week, which was not enough in terms of touristic volume for the local hotels, leading to pressure for an airport redevelopment in 1982: a new passenger terminal and a runway extension, allowing for bigger aircraft. It is now the fourth busiest airport in the country. Itâs a hub for Avianca and served by Air Century, American Airlines, Arajet, Avianca Costa Rica, Clic, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Edelweiss Air, JetBlue, KLM, Latam Colombia, Latam Peru, Spirit, Wingo. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed models, PBR materials, custom lighting, custom POIs (points of interest), and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $16.99. V1 owners are eligible for a discounted rate by buying the âSKCG V1 Improvementâ package.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
