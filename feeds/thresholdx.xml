    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SimWorks Studios has recently confirmed that its upcoming GA-8 Airvan will be released on the MSFS Marketplace on Aug. 21st, initially for MSFS 2020. A version tailored for MSFS 2024 will follow shortly after, and be made available at no extra cost to existing owners. The aircraft will launch in two editions. The base GA-8 Airvan will include both cargo and passenger configurations, authentic sound design, and fully modelled systems. An optional "SystemsPulse" expansion pack deepens the simulation further, adding features such as failures and persistent wear. The SystemsPulse expansion pack will require the base aircraft to function. While the base version is compatible with MSFS 2024, the SystemsPulse expansion is not, due to file system restrictions in the new simulator. A compatible version is already in development and will be released as a free update once complete. The aircraft package is prepared for upload, with review copies being distributed to streamers and media partners ahead of launch. SimWorks Studios has also confirmed that a storefront release of the Airvan will follow at a later date, once internal testing of a new installer is complete. The base GA-8 Airvan will retail for $29.99, with the SystemsPulse expansion pack being priced at $17.49. For all the latest flight simulation news, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG is celebrating its 28th anniversary this week, giving a suite of updates across its line of products. In a post on the PMDG forums, CEO Robert Randazzo confirmed that owners of the 737NG series for MSFSâ¯2020 must now migrate to Operations Centerâ¯3 (OC3), retiring the legacy InstallShield and OC2 system. The process involves uninstalling existing aircraft and liveries, reinstalling them via OC3, and then restoring liveries. The update preserves the current version, 3.0.112.  The 777 series has recently received an update, build 121, with additional fixes expected next week. The 777-200LR is scheduled for Marketplace release for both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 within 7â10 days. Randazzo also briefly addressed the 777X, noting that âpositive discussionsâ about access are underway. For MSFSâ¯2024, work is underway on the 737NG line, with beta testing expected to commence soon, alongside preview imagery. Meanwhile, the DCâ6 is currently awaiting improvements to MSFSâ¯2024âs LOD system to resolve visual issues before release. Development on the 737 MAX and the 747-100 and 400 is ongoing, though no release timeline has been specified.Â  In honour of its anniversary, PMDG is offering 28% off all products on PMDG.com, starting 0000â¯UTC on Aug. 7 through 2359â¯UTC on Aug.â¯10.  A YouTube version of Randazzoâs announcement is also available to watch here. For all the latest flight simulation news, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Middle Asia Developers has recently released their rendition of Tashkent International Airport (UTTT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Tashkent, in Uzbekistan, with a yearly average of 8.7 million passengers, making it the 8th busiest in the Post-Soviet states. The airportâs first records date back to 1924, when the first passenger flight was completed on a Junkers R-13, flying the Tashkent-Pishpek-Almaty route.Â  It eventually evolved into a transportation hub during the Soviet era, embracing the jet age as soon as 1957 with the Tu-104. By 1967, Tashkent had routes to Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Simferopol, certain cities in the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and some in the Far East. â The airport underwent many changes during the post-Soviet era, struggling to cope with the passenger volume. Western construction companies helped out quite significantly during the mid-1990s. Terminal 2 was rebuilt in 2001 to serve over 2 million passengers a year. It has modern waiting lounges, VIP halls, restaurants, bars, duty-free shops, and even a pharmacy. â Terminal 3 was launched a decade after Terminal 2, and it could handle 400 passengers per hour (half the capacity of Terminal 2). â The airport has been expanded in recent years, going from 45,000 square meters to 65,000 square meters of terminal area, allowing it to handle even more passengers per hour. â In August 2024, they finished another expansion project, renovating the airportâs facade while at it. Later that same year, they started expanding the arrivals hall by 2,500 square meters.Â  There are plans to merge the arrival and departure terminals by 2026. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, a basic interior, and much more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.64, requiring at least 984.50 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Impulse Simulations has recently released their rendition of Port Lincoln Airport (YPLC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Port Lincoln, South Australia, with a yearly average of 199,546 passengers. The airportâs history dates back to World War 2, when it was established as a Royal Australian Air Force training facility for bomber crews. This laid the groundwork for the infrastructure that would eventually become a civil airport in the not-so-distant future. For nine years after the war, the airport remained closed, only reopening as a civilian airport in 1954. It then had a short grass runway and rudimentary passenger infrastructure. During that time period, Adelaide was the only scheduled destination. Eleven years later, the infrastructure saw major improvements with the sealing of the runway and the construction of a new terminal building, attracting airlines such as ASA (Airlines of South Australia) with their Fokker 27s.Â  The start of the 21st century led to many changes and improvements as the region saw its demand increase with its growth as a tourist destination. A new terminal was inaugurated in 2013, significantly increasing its passenger handling capabilities and bringing modern amenities. QantasLink and Rex Regional Express are the only airlines currently serving Port Lincoln. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an accurate terminal model and its respective interior, custom ground textures, custom terrain and vegetation, high-quality PBR texturing, realistic night lighting, custom orthoimagery, performance-friendly optimization, a custom GSX profile, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.91, requiring at least 996.74 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Following its first teaser in a Facebook post earlier this month, Carenado has announced that the Beechcraft Baron B55 will be coming to MSFS 2024. The B55 is known for its stable handling, solid performance, and flexibility for both private and business flying.  Further updates have since been shared, including a closer look at the cockpit, featuring an Aspen Avionics EFD1000 unit. The product is also set to feature Carenadoâs new "RealXperienceâ concept, which aims to add extra depth to the flying experience by utilising some of the newer MSFS 2024 features, such as various wear and tear effects, dirt, vibrations, mud buildup, and bug splatters. The Beechcraft Baron family, including the short-body Baron 55, Baron 56, and long-body Baron 58, is a series of piston aircraft evolved from the Beechcraft Travel Air,Â  itself a twin-engined development of the Beechcraft Bonanza. Model 55 Barons were produced until the early 80s, with a total of 3,651 units manufactured between 1961 and 1983.  While Carenado has not confirmed a release date, more details, including avionics options and other features, are likely to be announced as the project nears completion.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Newcomers, CRZ Studio has recently released its first aircraft, the Chinook SJ from the Aeroplane Manufactory. CRZ Studio were founded in 2023 by two brothers, aiming to âbring highly authentic, handcrafted aircraft to the flight sim worldâ.Â  The Chinook SJ is an ultralight homebuilt kit aircraft available in two versions: one designed for the 4-stroke Rotax 912UL engine and the other for the 2-stroke Rotax 582UL engine. The 2-stroke version has now been recreated by CRZ Studio in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with the 4-stroke version coming at a later date. According to CRZ Studio, the Chinook SJ was developed using actual aircraft assembly manuals, ensuring unmatched accuracy and realism. The developers also claim that the Chinook SJ is the ideal aircraft for exploring remote islands, mountain valleys, and other inaccessible areas, thanks to its exceptional Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) performance. CRZ Studio has announced a variety of upcoming updates for the Chinook SJ. The future releases will, according to the developer, include a custom sound set for the Rotax 582 and 912 engines, a new sport light DR2 variant, an optional Rotax 912 engine, a floats configuration, optional GPS units, and dynamic effects for dirt, mud, dust, and grime, among other features. A DLC expansion celebrating the record-breaking competition-ready Chinook variant, titled "Dan Reynolds Valdez Special," is also in development. â The Chinook SJ Aeroplane by CRZ Studio is now available for $26.83 on CRZ Studio's website, exclusively for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon â</summary>
