    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RDPresets have recently released their rendition of Salzburg Airport (LOWS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Salzburg, Austria, with a yearly average of 300,000 passengers. Salzburg Airport was a race track when the first powered aircraft taxied on its surface in 1910. Sixteen years later, Lufthansa inaugurated a route from Munich to Bad Reichenhall with a stop in Salzburg. Austrian Aviation AG followed suit a year later with a Vienna-Salzburg-Innsbruck route. â The Luftwaffe seized it in 1939, where it was used by the Luftgaukommando VII and routinely visited by the Messerschmitt Me 262 during its development phase. The United States Air Force heavily bombed the city in 1944 (15 air raids), but the airport somehow remained undamaged. It was the first Austrian airport to return to scheduled traffic after WW2. â A new control tower was built in 1958, and a new passenger terminal was opened in 1966. â Itâs a hub for Eurowings Europe and is served by Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Finnair, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Transavia, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air. Most of them only operate seasonally. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D models, a custom interior with 3D passengers, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, custom taxiway signage, custom ground clutter, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $19.38, requiring at least 1.42 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. COWS have recently released their DA42 Series for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a rendition of the DA42-VI and DA42-TDI variants of the Diamond DA42 Twin Star, a popular twin-engine four-seater first flown in 2002 and introduced in 2004. â Christian Dries, Diamondâs founder and chief executive officer, approached their design team in the late 1990s with a concept for a twin-engined aircraft, which eventually became their first twin-engined airplane, with over 600 built since its inception. It was idealized to be simple, fuel-efficient, and luxurious.Â  Seating up to four people, it can cruise at 326 km/h with a total range of 2,250 km, making it a solid luxury commuter. The DA42-VI, the first variant, features improvements in the propellers and aerodynamics, allowing it to cruise faster and more efficiently.Â  The add-on features a high-fidelity visual model with photorealistic texturing, accurate placards, fiberglass scratching, an intricate interior model with moderate or heavy wear, two-panel color options, a flight model tried and tested by DA42 students and flight instructors, with accurate performance figures and handling, a true-to-life electrical system with circuit breakers and custom alternator voltage simulation, custom standby flight instrumentation, custom hydraulic gear system simulation, engine damage, state saving, a dynamic sound engine, and much more. Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $30.18, requiring at least 2.88 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iBlueYonder has recently announced and teased their rendition of Lelystad Airport (EHLE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Lelystad and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. It's the country's biggest general aviation airport, home to an important aviation museum. â It was idealized in 1966 and had its first flights in 1971, albeit not yet as an official airport, which only happened in 1973. With grass taxiways and runways at first, it was often closed because of muddy terrain, rendering it useless as a landing strip. It wasn't until 1978 that the taxiways were finally hardened, followed by runway paving in 1981. â It was purchased by the Schiphol Group in 1993, the same company that manages Amsterdam Schiphol, the busiest and main airport in the Netherlands. â A decade later, the Schiphol Group moved the Aviodrome Museum from Schiphol to Lelystad, where it has been headquartered ever since and holds various events every year. â The airport is currently under expansion work, driven by Schiphol reaching its maximum capacity and its geographic proximity to Amsterdam. The House of Representatives begs to differ, though, with a motion in January 2024 that blocks the usage of the airport for commercial aviation.  â Developed by Ronald Fleurbaaij, a new member of iBlueYonder, the scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport and is scheduled to reach completion before this year's FSWeekend in March. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AuraScenery has recently released their rendition of Aberdeen International Airport (EGPD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, and Moray in Scotland, with a yearly average of 1.9 million passengers. It opened in 1934 as Dyce Aerodrome, established by Eric Gandar Dower for his many enterprises, including a flying school, a flying club, and an airline, Aberdeen Airways.Â  â It became an RAF base during WW2 (RAF Dyce), housing the No. 13 Group. Even though it had a few fighter aircraft, the baseâs main purpose was photographic reconnaissance.Â  It was bombed twice by the Germans in 1940, but no damage was reported, thanks to a decoy site nearby that operated full-time thanks to an underground generator, leading the enemies to think it was an active air base. They had cleverly concocted a system where a flarepath and a rotating lamp would âsimulateâ taxiing aircraft. Nothing remains from the RAF days due to the constant expansion and development of the industrial areas around the airport, leading to many reconstructions. A new terminal was built in 1947, along with a new control tower.Â  It underwent a massive redevelopment program between 2016 and 2019, doubling its passenger handling capabilities.Â  It has recently been elected the Scottish Airport of the Year (2022) and the Hub of the Year (2023).Â  Itâs a focus city for Eastern Airways, Loganair, and TUI Airways. Aer Lingus, airBaltic, BH Air, British Airways, Eastern Airways, easyJet, KLM, Ryanair, Scandinavian Airlines, Wideroe, and Wizz Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with more than 100 high-detail buildings, high-quality apron textures, detailed landscaping, realistic night lighting, custom ground materials, and highly optimized models. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $14.52, requiring at least 3.16 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Publishes A320 Block 2 Feature Review Video</title>
    <updated>2024-02-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fnxfrv"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65cbe36656dfb85750418540_fenixblock4.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations recently uploaded a video to their YouTube channel with a deep dive into the upcoming Block 2 update for their Airbus A320, showcasing some of the new features and intricacies of their new custom engine model. The 47-minute video begins with a demonstration of their new PA system, one of the new features of the upcoming update. Users will be able to have customizable PA sounds on a per airline (ICAO/IATA) basis, and the audio files will be played randomly (within a set time frame, of course) rather than as soon as a new action begins (boarding, deboarding, etc.) to simulate a human cabin crew.  Aamir Thacker, the CEO, then apologizes for the many delays and their recent âradio silence,â along with justifying why they have opted to delay it for so long and why it turned out beneficial in the long run, paving the way for future products with an accurate and entirely agnostic engine model that could be adapted to fit any need they might have in the future. The next part of the video covers the full GSX integration and the new Electronic Flight Bag, which was rewritten from scratch. GSX will now handle refueling, boarding, luggage, and pushback automatically, with no input required from the user or the need for external software other than GSX itself. The new EFB, while maintaining visual similarity with the previous, will be snappier and more feature-fledged than before, allowing for finer control of the settings and failures, along with their respective codes for troubleshooting with the quick reference handbook. The following five minutes cover the new flight model and their new stick dampening simulation, which aims to bring the feel of a real Airbus sidestick to our homes, albeit with a strong emphasis on it still not being exactly like the real thing due to how the real sidestick works in comparison to an average USB flight stick.   The remaining thirty minutes showcase the star of the show: the new external engine model and its many intricacies, including a demonstration of how to crank an IAE engine when itâs 42C outside and the exact opposite: the engineâs behavior when itâs cold outside and how icing on the fan blades can lead to potentially catastrophic issues. The final demonstration showcases compressor stalls, a rare but certainly concerning issue that can happen if the winds are âjust right.â Aamir also mentions they have struck a new deal with ProSim, which will allow hardware such as physical MCDUs and FCUs to work with the Fenix, which was not possible before due to the nature of their first deal. Fenix has not revealed the release date for the update yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BMWorld and AmSim have recently released their rendition of Miami International Airport (KMIA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Miami metropolitan area with a yearly average of 52.3 million passengers, which makes it the 9th busiest airport in the United States. It opened in 1928 as Pan American Field, after Pan American World Airways, which had purchased a plot of land beside a pre-existing Miami City Airport (dating back to the early 20s) to build it.Â  World War 2 led to the construction of Miami Army Airfield, which sat south of the Pan American Field with separate runways yet was listed as a single facility by some airport directories. Right after World War 2, in 1945, Miami established a Port Authority and purchased Pan American Field from Pan American World Airways, eventually merging it with the Miami Army Airfield in 1949.Â  A new passenger terminal was opened in 1959, the largest central airport terminal in the world at the time, with five concourses and a 270-room hotel. It was later renovated and expanded through the 1990s. The airport currently features three terminals and six concourses, with 131 gates in total.Â  Itâs a hub for ABX Air, American Airlines, Amerijet International, Atlas Air, Avianca Cargo, Eastern Airlines, FedEx Express, Havana Air, iAero Airways, IBC Airways, LATAM Cargo Chile, Mas Air, Nothern Air Cargo, Sky Lease Cargo, UPS Airlines, Western Global Airlines, and World Atlantic Airlines.

    <title>Just Flight Publishes PA-38 Tomahawk Development Update </title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published a new progress update on the development of the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a single-engined low-wing fixed tricycle gear general aviation airplane primarily used for flight training, touring, and personal use. â The developers have worked hard over the past few weeks on systems, modeling, texturing, sounds, and additional features that will be mentioned in the future.  â â They have implemented an interactive walkaround mode, accessible via the EFB, allowing users to navigate the aircraft's exterior and interact with various components. A mini checklist will show which components can be checked and interacted with, ranging from chocks, tie-downs, tow bar, control surfaces, stall warning tab, and the propeller. â The PA-38 Tomahawk will also feature wear and tear simulation, with components wearing out over time, with different wear rates depending on how the aircraft is treated. Distinct operational behaviors will result in different wear rates, as in real life. Components will be repairable, and high wear will render it unsuitable for flight. â The instruments will be affected by the amount of suction in the vacuum system, particularly noticeable when starting the engine, making the attitude indicator and direction indicator wobble as the suction increases.  â Their texture artist has been retexturing the entire exterior, which is not reflected in the provided screenshots (it still shows the old texture set, as it's serving as a placeholder until the new set is ready).  â There is still no release date information, but they say the finish line is getting closer.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Just Flight Publishes Tornado GR1 Development Update</title>
    <updated>2024-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfltor"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65cfe6d82f553d7a4c7a0333_tornado.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published a progress update on the development of their Tornado GR1 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a twin-engine combat aircraft jointly developed and manufactured by Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany.  â First flown in 1974 and officially introduced in 1979, the Panavia Tornado was operated by the German Air Force, Royal Air Force, Italian Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force, with 990 units built in total.  â Just Flightâs rendition is modeled after the ZA465 âFoxy Killer,â who served with the No. 16 RAF Squadron during the Gulf War (1990-1991) and is now preserved for posterity by the Imperial War Museum Duxford. â Their livery artist has been creating 8K liveries that will be included with the Tornado GR1 at release. They will cover the IDS and ECR variants across the Royal Air Force, German Air Force, German Navy, Italian Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force in a mixture of standard and special liveries. The liveries they have showcased are all UK-centric, with more to come in future development updates. â Unlike some of their previous projects, they claim to have entirely scratched the old code from P3D, writing all the systems from scratch. Work is said to be well underway, with functionality added to the electrical, fuel, and hydraulic systems that lay the foundations for all other systems. While itâs no small feat, they have a dedicated systems coder, and the process should progress at a good pace, with Just Flight believing that it will bring the level of their simulation up to the highest standard within the confines of what is possible with Microsoft Flight Simulator. â They will share more information as it progresses, and Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>
