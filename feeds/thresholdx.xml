    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AviaSim Designs recently released their rendition of Conington Aerodrome / Peterborough Business Airport (EGSF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This privately owned airfield is 13 kilometers south of Peterborough in the English county of Cambridgeshire. Originally built as RAF Glatton in 1942-1943 by the 809th United States Army Corps of Engineers to house B-17 bombers of the 457th Bomb Group, it was passed to the Royal Air Force after the end of the war. A year later, it was mothballed, and most of the structure vanished over the following years, leaving just a hangar and a water tower. The airfield saw some use in the 1960s from two local companies, which used its runway and hangar to store their aircraft. A ground engineer provided basic maintenance facilities.Â  Aerolease Ltd. currently operates it, and aviation fuel is available on-site. Hangarage and parking must be arranged beforehand. The current layout consists of two runways: runway 16/34, which isnât AIP or NAPS listed, is approximately 800 meters long and in worse condition than the listed one (10/28), which is slightly longer at 987 meters. The scenery features an up-to-date layout, custom aerial imagery, 4K PBR textures, custom ground poly, sloped runway profile, dynamic lighting, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.86, requiring at least 335.30 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. ShortFinal Design recently released its rendition of San Jose International Airport (KSJC) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves Santa Clara Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and has a yearly average of 12 million passengers. â Officially opened in 1939, its first proper runway was only built six years later on land leased by test pilot James M. Nissen and his partners. A hangar and an office building for a flight school were also built.Â  The city took over shortly after, with James Nissen becoming the airport's first manager, considerably instrumental in its infrastructural development. â The increased demand for air travel in the 1960s led to constructing the first proper terminal building, which later became Terminal C. Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, SJC witnessed continued growth. Terminal A opened in 1990, followed by the city council's approval of a new master plan for long-term expansion in 1997. The airport has seen the introduction of international flights, including the first trans-Pacific service to Tokyo launched by American Airlines in 1991. â Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, United Express, Volaris, and Zipair Tokyo serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, detailed models for all buildings, terminals with fully modeled interiors, PBR materials, custom dynamic night lighting, high-resolution photo imagery, 3D vegetation, and more. â It's available on theÂ X-Plane.Org StoreÂ for $22.95, requiring at least 1.2 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has recently released the long-awaited Sim Update 5 for Microsoft Flight Simulator after a series of delays and controversies. The new update brings performance improvements, faster loading times, airport fixes, and the A320neo V2 by iniBuilds. â Focusing on performance gains and stability, Sim Update 15 claims to bring significant framerate gains where it was otherwise low, fewer stutters, especially on long sessions, and substantially faster loading times. The performance figures on glass cockpit heavy airplanes, such as the 747, have also been greatly improved thanks to their work optimizing the Coherent/JS tech stack. On the stability front, Microsoft has devised a way to stop the console version from crashing when it runs out of memory by detecting the issue before it happens and temporarily reallocating the memory, causing a brief loss of detail quality while preventing a hard crash. â The physics front has also seen changes, with a new high-accuracy physics system to enable vibrations and micro-movements, a more accurate ground contact model, and an optional soft ground collision model for tires and flexible gears.Â  â The A320neo V2 by iniBuilds is now available, featuring a high-quality 3D model, improved system fidelity, high-resolution textures, and a high-detail cabin for PC users. Microsoft has shared a video introducing us to the brand-new aircraft: â The complete changelog follows below: â The update is available right now on all compatible platforms.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. ST Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of Maastricht-Aachen Airport (EHBK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Maastricht, in the Netherlands, and Aachen, in Germany, with a yearly average of 97.000 passengers. It was built by the Allies as a temporary airfield during World War 2, later transferred to the Dutch government and named Beek Airfield. It saw lots of traffic during its initial months because most roads in the country had been bombed and/or heavily damaged. As the repairs progressed, the traffic figures died down. The first semi-permanent terminal was built in 1947, followed by runway paving work in 1949 and 1950. Further expansion work was carried on from 1951 and beyond after an agreement between the airport and the Dutch Air Force. The airport underwent expansion work in the early 1970s to handle bigger aircraft, which included runway lengthening, taxiway widening, and apron enlargement. A decade later, a new passenger terminal was built, replacing the old one from the 40s. Corendon Dutch Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, and Ryanair serve it. â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, custom taxiway signage, custom objects, PBR texturing, aÂ realistic runway profile, and more.

In 1994, a brand new terminal was built, with eight gates and expansion possibilities. Five departure gates were dutifully added in 2007.Â  It won #1 Best Domestic Airport two years in a row (2021 and 2022) in Travel+Leisure Worldâs Best Awards. The method was a survey among the readers that took accessibility, shopping, check-in, restaurants, cleanliness, and many other factors into account. The airportâs domestic popularity was also reinforced by CondÃ© Nast Traveler, which ranked it the best in the United States for three years in a row. Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air and served by American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, custom jetways, and more. â Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.15, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Gate15Scenery has recently released the second version of its Rishiri Airport (RJER) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the entirety of Rishiri Island in Hokkaido Prefecture and has a yearly average of 38.000 passengers. The airport was built in the late 1960s when air travel was gaining momentum in Japan, and connecting remote islands became a priority. Initially, the airport served a limited number of flights, primarily connecting Rishiri to the nearby Wakkanai Airport on the mainland. However, its presence proved crucial in boosting tourism and facilitating the transportation of goods and services. The airport also became a vital link for emergency medical services, ensuring timely access to specialized care for the island's residents. Over the years, Rishiri Airport has witnessed steady growth. The runway was extended in 1990 to accommodate larger aircraft, allowing for more direct flights and increased passenger capacity. Today, the airport serves several domestic destinations, including Sapporo and Tokyo, making travel to and from the island more convenient. Beyond its role in transportation, Rishiri Airport has become a symbol of the island's connection to the broader world. It serves as a gateway for visitors to experience the island's natural beauty, from the majestic Mount Rishiri to its diverse marine life. It's currently only served by ANA Wings and Hokkaido Air System, with flights to Sapporo (Chitose and Okadama). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Owners of the previous version are eligible for a free upgrade. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 298.89 MB of free hard disk space to install.
