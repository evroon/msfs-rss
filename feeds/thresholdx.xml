    <title>Just Flight Publishes A300B4 Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. As part of their End of Year Round Up, Just Flight has shared some of the progress on the A300B4 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024, with its exterior artwork nearing completion and ready for showcasing. They have meticulously hand-placed thousands of rivets on every inch of the aircraftâs surface, with the tail area being the most obvious due to its housing of so many critical structures. Special attention has been paid to weathering, resulting in a representation of an airframe that has been in service for many years, complete with streaks of dirt, detritus, traces of rainwater, run-down panels, and more. The flight deck is no different, as they have previously shared. Just Flight considers their A300B4 to be one of the most accurately represented wide-body airliners in any flight simulator. A bold claim, as they note, but they will let the people be the judges. As for the remaining work on the art department, their artist is currently finishing the textures of the landing gear, wheels, and landing gear bays, before eventually focusing on the cargo hold interiors. Once that is out of the way, the artwork will be complete for the A300B4-203 variant. But the -203 isnât the only variant modeled, so thereâs still a bit more work to do: the showcased plane is actually an A300B4-103, for example. A freighter variant will also be included. With that being said, they are not ready yet to show any of the other planned variants. â After the texturing work is complete, they will move on to livery creation for the variants at hand, and they promise to provide a large selection of top-quality work that will represent the A300B4âs diverse range of operators from every habitable continent.  â Furthermore, the developers have finally been able to share previews of the passenger cabin, modelled into a two-class layout from the 1980s, with the First Class cabin featuring 24 seats in a 2+2+2 configuration, and the economy cabin featuring 230 seats in a 2+4+2 configuration, narrowing at the rear to a 2+3+2 configuration. In line with their other products, the cabin will feature numerous simulated elements, offering âlots to play withâ during the cruise phase. The cabin artwork is deemed ready, but there may be minor changes between what has been showcased and the final product at the time of release, most notably related to cabin lighting, as it has not yet been implemented. The flight model is progressing decently, and the extensive data they sourced from a variety of A300B4 variants has been proven rather useful, allowing it to perform as faithfully as possible to the numbers. The systems have now been fully coded, and the plane is getting ready to enter wider beta testing. Among the most recently completed systems, they highlight the Carousel IV-A Inertial Navigation System and the autopilot logic. â Since they have something nearing completion, they can finally begin proper testing with their beta team, allowing them to delve deeply into the system's intricacies to cross-check their functionalities against the aircraftâs FCOM and mitigate any issues that may arise. â Just Flight will be sharing more details earlier next year.

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Releases Katowice Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/694464dfc3eed8da3962b8bf_epkt1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Katowice Wojciech Korfanty Airport (EPKT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area with a yearly average of 6.4 million passengers, making it the 4th busiest airport in Poland. It was originally built by the Luftwaffe in 1940, with three stone and concrete airstrips of varying lengths. It was used for handling military aircraft flying from Germany, carrying supplies to troops on the Eastern Front. It was also briefly used for aircraft testing in the final phase of World War 2. In 1945, the airfield was taken over by the Soviets, and it was subsequently handed over to Poland in the early 1950s, where it was used to house the Polish Air Forceâs 39th Fighter Regiment. A new runway was built in the mid-1960s, and regular scheduled passenger traffic began in 1966. Polandâs entry into the European Union has substantially accelerated the airportâs growth, with Wizz Air choosing Katowice as its first base outside Hungary. Other low-cost carriers followed suit within the next couple of years. A second terminal was built in 2007 specifically for Schengen flights, and an arrivals-only terminal (Terminal C) followed in 2015. That year also marked the construction of Katowiceâs new runway, which is 3200 meters in length (the second-longest runway in Poland). Itâs a focus city for ASL Airlines Ireland, Buzz (Ryanair), Electra Airways, Enter Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, Ryanair, Skyline Express, Smartwings Poland, and Wizz Air. Air Cairo, Air Dolomiti, Corendon Airlines, Freebird Airlines, Lufthansa, Nesma Airlines, Nouvelair, Pegasus Airlines, Plus Ultra, and Tailwind Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, a custom terminal interior, custom ground service equipment, an accurate runway profile, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $24.62, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released their long-awaited physics-based camera system for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, providing realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, creating unparalleled immersion. For the unfamiliar, ChasePlane was originally released in 2016 for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and later became compatible with Prepar3D, rapidly becoming the de facto camera application for ESP-based simulators at the time. After many years of waiting, Parallel 42 finally managed to break Asoboâs absurdly locked camera system, bringing ChasePlane to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 in early 2025, with the promise of eventually making it 2024 compatible, which has now been fulfilled. â The add-on features highly realistic physics-based camera behavior based on extensive research and real-world pilot footage. This warrants realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, embracing the flight model rather than altering it. Pilots can feel the vibration during the take-off roll, the rush of turbulence, and the fluid shifts during maneuvers. â ChasePlane 2020 owners can upgrade to 2024 for free by using the code âCPWENâ at the checkout page. â Itâs available in their store for $30.00.

    <title>iniBuilds Announces Liverpool John Lennon and Dallas Fort Worth Airports for MSFS24</title>
    <updated>2025-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/iadfwl"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In their most recent scenery development recap on their forums, iniBuilds has confirmed that they are working on renditions of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (EGGP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is one of the worldâs busiest airports by aircraft movement, and recreating the complexity and scale of the airport has been quite the task for the iniBuilds team. Development work has been underway for months, ranging from detailed ground poly work to getting the unique architecture of the terminals correct. Greg Jones, iniBuildsâ Head of Scenery and Geospatial Development, says that DFWâs size has been a challenge for the team to adapt their work flow integrating new features.Â  âAdopting MSFS2024 as our core development platform gave us new opportunities to introduce levels of detail and quality previously not possible. â¦ Early in 2025, we had a commercial opportunity to work on Dallas Fort Worth. We jumped at the chance to produce what will be, by far, the largest project weâve ever doneâ, Jones explains. He expands on their goals for DFW, stating that they are putting âperformance at the core of everythingâ and â[The] testing team is hard at work ironing out any kinks, and so far the results have been stellarâ. As of writing, iniBuilds has not confirmed a release date for their rendition of DFW, but they say that users âshouldnât have to wait many more monthsâ for a release. â Following in the footsteps of their recent release of Manchester and Leeds Bradford v2, iniBuildsâ newest UK airport will be Liverpool John Lennon, an airport with a rich history and scenic approach over the river Mersey. In their announcement iniBuilds asks for help from anyone who works at Liverpool John Lennon Airport or has airside access and can provide high-quality reference photography or technical data. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently published a new development update regarding the long-awaited Pratt &amp; Whitney update for their A321neo, released earlier this year with LEAPs as the sole engine option initially. A combination of technical challenges and continued changes introduced through Sim Updates in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has necessitated unexpected additional work and testing validation, which has pushed the updateâs rollout date forward. Furthermore, they are actively supporting Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, while also laying the groundwork for a fully native 2024 product line, which adds further complexity to their development process. Rather than pushing a half-baked update, FSLabs chose to wait it out until itâs all deemed properly stable, avoiding a sequence of micro-updates.  They also do not expect the aforementioned update to be released before Christmas, as they donât want to put unnecessary strain on their quality assurance and support teams, and they want to ensure full availability when the update is shipped. Development and testing will absolutely not stop during the holidays, though. They have also shared a few screenshots from their Â current work-in-progress builds, and more details will be shared soon. â The add-on is available on their website for $69.95.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has recently released their updated rendition of Rovaniemi Airport (EFRO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the third-busiest airport in Finland, serving 500,000 passengers annually. It was built in 1940, originally featuring two grass runways. It was heavily utilized as a Luftwaffe Air base and supply center during the Second Soviet-Finnish War between 1941 and 1944. By the end of the conflict, the airport was heavily compromised. Rebuilding work was concluded in 1948, and regular traffic resumed in the second half of the same year. The current terminal building was completed in 1992 and expanded in 2000 with the addition of jetways. The runway underwent renovation work in 2016, with new pavement and LED lights, and 2019 marked the completion of the terminalâs third enlargement. Itâs served all year long by Finnair, and a multitude of European carriers visit Rovaniemi during the winter season (Aer Lingus, Air France, easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, to name a few). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality 3D models, custom terminal interiors, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, precise runway elevation data, and more. â Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $19.42, requiring at least 3.04 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.4.0 Beta</title>
    <updated>2025-12-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1240"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/694b2a1a5c5001242ad2008a_CCheck_Update_Title_1-1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In a surprise announcement, Laminar Research has released the beta version of their C-Check update, better known as X-Plane 12.4.0 Beta. The stated goal of the beta is to lay the groundwork forÂ  X-Planeâs future.Â  Laminar Research has accomplished this by replacing core elements of the simulator and improving aircraft systems. The default A330 has been reworked to a "payware level", now, for example, allowing for realistic cold and dark starts. It also gives you the tools needed to conduct proper oceanic and long-haul flights. This includes a third MCDU for Airline Operational Communications.Â  The autopilot system has also been improved, making for smoother turns, better flight plan tracking, and more reliable coupled approaches. Finally, emergencies can now be simulated. On the general aviation side, X-Planeâs default X430 and X530 now have working terrain, traffic, and weather pages, while the X1000 now features a dedicated page showing ETE/ETA.Â  For lovers of custom scenery, the team has included a rendition of Bilbao Airport (LEBB) in Spain. Other improvements in the beta include native support for the Tobii Eye Tracker 5 on Windows, multi-threaded scenery processing, virtual reality improvements, ATC improvements, and more! You can find the full release notes here.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
