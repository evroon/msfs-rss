    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Colombian Virtual Design has recently released its version of CapitÃ¡n Vicente Almandos Almonacid Airport (SANL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This airport, located in the Argentinian city of La Rioja, serves around 63,000 people annually. The airport of La Rioja opened in 1948, and its first terminal was built three years later, in 1951. In 1969, the airport's grass runway was replaced with a new asphalt runway, which is still in use today. In 1978, a new passenger terminal and car parking were added, and the terminal had air conditioning installed in 1990. The airport has two domestic destinations, San Fernando del Valle de Catama and the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, operated by the airline Aerolineas Argentinas. The scenery includes various features, such as an accurate rendition of the airport, a custom terminal, and a realistic ground layout, and it is performance-friendly for the simulator. The airport requires 55MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for $7.58USD. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft has recently released Newcastle International Airport (EGNT) for X-Plane 12. The airport, located in Newcastle, UK, is the 11th busiest airport in the country, serving around 4.8 million passengers per year. Newcastle International Airport, originally Woolsington Aerodrome, was established in 1935. During the Second World War, the airfield played an important role in training RAF aircrew and was occasionally used to operate detachments of the Supermarine Spitfire fighters. In 1967, a new runway, terminal, apron, and air traffic control tower were constructed, leading to a rapid increase in passenger numbers. Since then, the airport has undergone multiple expansions and other projects, becoming the focus city for airlines like Jet2.com, Ryanair, and TUI Airways. It now offers over 80 direct destinations, ranging from sunny Rhodes to rainy Bergen, or even chilly Reykjavik. â The newly released scenery, updated from the original X-Plane 11 version, features custom PBR ground textures, animated jetways, tower interior, revised lighting, revised orthophoto, reworked autogen, and much more. â The add-on requires 2.6GB of storage space and is available on the Aerosoft Shop for approximately $18.20.

    <title>Vref Simulations Announces Guarulhos International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <link href="/news/vrfgru"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/661763efd36cec2f33c8e941_guarulhos1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Vref Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's set to release tomorrow (11/04) for $8.99. Further information can be found on Vref'sÂ Discord. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Although these airlines have stopped these routes, the airport still has multiple international and domestic destinations. The Silvio Pettirossi International Airport is a hub for LATAM Paraguay and Paranair, and airlines like Air Europa and Avianca offer routes to destinations like Madrid, BogotÃ¡, and Buenos Aires. â â The new scenery features a highly accurate rendition of Silvio Pettirossi International Airport, full night illumination, dynamic lighting, PBR materials, and much more. â â â The add-on requires 440.69MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $18.17.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has released its version of BahÃ­a Blanca Airport (SAZB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport, also known as Comandante Espora Airport, is located in Argentina and serves the city of BahÃ­a Blanca. The airport is located 3.1 miles (5 km) from the city and caters to around 300,000 passengers annually. BahÃ­a Blanca Airport was opened as Comandante Espora Air Naval Base in 1930 to replace the old Puerto Belgrano Air Naval Base, which lacked the necessary facilities for handling new aircraft types. From 1945 to 1964, the airport served as the Naval Aviation School, and in 1970, the Naval Command headquarters moved to the airport. It wasn't until 1968 that the airport started handling civil and commercial traffic. Today, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas connects the airport to multiple domestic destinations like Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, and Trelew. The BahÃ­a Blanca Airport scenery package boasts several features, including custom jetways, custom taxiway and runway textures, PBR textures, hand-modeled exterior and interior, accurate rendition of the Comandante Espora Air Naval Base, and much more. The add-on requires 875.96MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.85. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
