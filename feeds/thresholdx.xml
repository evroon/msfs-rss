    <title>X-Crafts Posts Development Update for the ERJ Family 2.0</title>
    <updated>2025-12-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xcrfterjdec"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/69525d539ee102ae2394925a_ERJ-FAMILY-2.0-FULL-SYSTEMS-SIMULATION-PREVIEW_12.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts has provided an update on the upcoming ERJ Family 2.0 for X-Plane, confirming that the aircraft will not be released in 2025 as previously announced. The X-Crafts ERJ Family 2.0 will not be released in 2025, as the company has chosen to prioritise quality over meeting that deadline. They indicated that the main reason for the delay is that they have pushed their development efforts further than ever before. According to X-Crafts, their real ERJ pilot testers can fly the aircraft just like they would in real life, and 99 percent of all cockpit buttons are operational. The only exceptions are circuit breakers or buttons that cannot be realistically simulated in a flight simulator. Marko Mamula, founder of X-Crafts, states that all systems, including flight controls and an authentic FMS with holding patterns, have been implemented. A detailed systems showcase has also been posted. AirComms is a new on-screen interface designed to assist you in flying the aircraft. It will feature interactive tutorials, offer tips on when to perform specific actions, and provide warnings if certain tasks are overlooked. AirComms looks to be aimed at users who are less familiar with the ERJ Family, helping them to quickly get up to speed. X-Crafts has not provided an updated release date, but the aircraft is largely complete. They have mentioned that the main things still needed are documentation, website resources, screenshots, and other materials. â For more on the ERJ Family 2.0, check out Marko Mamulaâs blog post. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. After the long wait, LevelUp has finally released the 737NG Series V2 Stage 1 update for X-Plane 12!Â  The new update brings new FMOD sounds, 8K exterior textures and new models, a remodelled cabin interior, as well as the newest ZiboMod systems update. Both the exterior and the interior have received big upgrades, with higher poly counts on the exterior - winglets, engine cowlings and gear tyres, which will make them look smoother compared to the older version. Along with the new 3D models, textures were also a part of the update, as all the above-mentioned items now have 8K textures. Meanwhile, the cabin has received a refresh, with the new models that are closer to the seats mostly used in today's aircraft. Another big part of the update are the new sounds. Using the 2.0 FMOD, it features an entirely new soundset, with plenty of new and improved sounds, such as stick shaker rattle, bleed air rush after shut-down, HUD handling sounds, improved environment sounds, cabin chatter, touchdown sounds, as well as improved touchdown sound logic. The LevelUp 737NG Series V2 update is available for download on the Threshold forums and the OrbxDirect for free, and requires just 0.94GB of free disk space. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Meridian GMT Website Relaunch Goes Live, Reveals Full Hardware Line-Up</title>
    <updated>2025-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/newgmt"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/69559d21c030d96f3ecf5e9c_latitude-product%20(1).webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Meridian GMT has officially launched its redesigned website, marking a significant milestone for the studio and putting its long-teased hardware ecosystem in the spotlight.Â This follows the initial announcement made by Meridian on Christmas Day. The updated product pages are now available at MeridianGMT.com, showcasing various imagery, specifications, and feature breakdowns for the Horizon Plus Flight Controls, Latitude Plus Throttle Quadrant, and the X-Ray Handheld FlightDeck. At the centre of the line-up is the Horizon Plus Flight Controls, Meridianâs flagship yoke system, designed around a modular architecture that allows pilots to tailor the setup for airliner or general aviation operations.Â  The system combines a full-range roll axis with a deliberately asymmetric pitch mechanism, providing precision during rotation, approach, and landing. At the same time, modular avionics bays on either side allow panels to be swapped, as flying styles change. Sitting alongside it is the Latitude Plus Throttle Quadrant, a highly configurable throttle solution, with interchangeable lever sets and magnetic faceplates. This allows for quick transitions between various Boeing, Airbus, and GA configurations. Rounding out the ecosystem is the X-Ray Handheld FlightDeck, a compact controller designed for couch and casual flying, with magnetic faceplates, tactile controls, and a strong emphasis on accessibility.Â  Full information on X-Ray compatibility, particularly for console use, will follow once licensing processes are completed in January. â The website relaunch also confirms Meridianâs move away from its earlier phonetic naming scheme, with product names now aligned directly to the brandâs identity, a change founder Nicki says represents a clean break from the companyâs past, and a renewed focus on its own design language.Â  According to the published roadmap, a non-binding pre-order sign-up for the Horizon Plus Flight Controls is planned to open on Jan. 20, 2026, serving as a system and demand test, with full pre-orders expected from Feb. 1, 2026. The Latitude Plus Throttle Quadrant will follow shortly after. They also plan to showcase hands-on prototypes at FSWeekend in Lelystad and at FlightSimExpo 2026 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, ahead of beta units and wider pre-orders rolling out during the second quarter of 2026.  Pre-orders will, however, only open once production timelines are formally locked in with manufacturing partners. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SkyHigh Studios has announced that it is developing Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, marking the studioâs first confirmed project for the new platform.Â  The announcement was shared alongside a small selection of early in-sim screenshots, offering an initial look at the airportâs terminal areas, surrounding buildings, and parts of the cargo complex. Liszt Ferenc, named after the famous Hungarian composer Franz Liszt, is Hungaryâs primary international gateway, and a significant hub for Central and Eastern Europe.  It has a strong presence from Wizz Air, alongside numerous cargo and long-haul operators, also previously hosting the now-defunct Hungarian flag carrier, MalÃ©v. SkyHigh Studios has not yet shared detailed feature lists or technical specifications. However, the previews suggest a focus on details, including terminal interiors, landside structures, and airport-adjacent scenery, all of which are still clearly in early development. No release window has been confirmed at this time. SkyHigh Studios says more information will be shared as development progresses.  Weâll keep you updated.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. REX Simulations has released Technical Update 1.0 for REX Atmos CORE, delivering a wide-ranging update focused on stability, compatibility, and weather rendering improvements for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The headline change is full compatibility with Sim Update 4, addressing multiple integration points affected by the update, including environmental data offsets and API communication, ensuring Atmos Core continues to inject weather and atmospheric changes reliably.Â  Alongside this, REX has resolved long-standing issues with custom weather rendering across METAR, Simple, and Advanced modes, rebuilding the internal hooks to improve multi-layer atmospheric rendering, cloud behaviour, and lighting synchronisation. Several usability and reliability fixes are also included, such as corrected UI validation that previously blocked preset saving, improved reading of the local settings.json file, and minor interface clean-ups. The update also introduces a new startup log system, designed to verify application processes during launch, as well as simulator runtime validation, which confirms that the simulator is running before Atmos Core initialises, reducing the risk of errors or failed startups. REX notes that this is a full version release, and strongly recommends uninstalling all previous versions of Atmos Core before installing build 8.1.2025.1210.  For the full release notes, visit REX's Discord server, or click here.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Synaptic Simulations has shared a brief end-of-year development update on its upcoming A220, offering a snapshot of where the project stands as it heads into 2026. Over the past year, the team has made steady progress across the aircraftâs core systems, including engine control, fly-by-wire, and autoflight logic, as well as a significant rebuild of the flight management system, to support deeper system integration.Â  System complexity has continued to grow, with the EICAS now featuring more than 100 messages. At the same time, ongoing revisions to both the engine and flight models aim to further refine the aircraftâs handling and performance.Â  Looking ahead, Synaptic says testing will ramp up in the coming months, with a focus on LNAV behaviour across global procedures, VNAV integration, and ensuring that performance data is adequately respected by guidance and engine systems. A handful of remaining systems, including pressurisation and autobrakes, are still being finalised.Â  While the A220 did not release in 2025, the team reiterated that the extra time is being used to deliver a more complete, polished product, with further updates expected, as development continues into the new year.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The community survey for the Flightsim Awards 2026 is now live, marking the opening of the official nomination phase for next yearâs awards.Â  The survey allows simmers to nominate projects, developers, creators, and long-term contributors they believe made a meaningful impact on the flight simulation scene in 2025. The nomination phase plays a key role in shaping the final shortlist, covering a wide range of categories across aircraft, scenery, tools, freeware, hardware, innovation, and community contributions.Â  Participants are free to nominate in as many or as few categories as they wish, with no requirement to complete the entire form. All submissions will be reviewed and passed on to the Flightsim Awards organising board and jury, alongside nominations gathered from invited content creators and media outlets. The goal is to ensure that the final voting slate reflects a broad community sentiment, rather than a curated selection. All entries are evaluated according to shared principles: The survey is being distributed jointly by Threshold, FSElite, and Cruiselevel, who together organise the Flight Sim Awards. Public voting will follow later in the process, with a jury step only used in cases of ties or irregular results. Nominations are open until the published deadline, with eligibility limited to products and projects released or significantly updated in 2025.Â  The winners will be revealed during the Captainâs Dinner at FlightSimWeekend 2026, on Friday, March 20.  â Take the nomination survey here.  You can read more on the Flight Sim Awards website.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSoares has recently teased the development progress on his Rio de Janeiro/GaleÃ£o International Airport (SBGL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This is the main airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a yearly average of 14.5 million passengers. It was opened in 1952 on top of a pre-existing Brazilian Air Force base that was utilized by international long-haul flights, which were too heavy and too large for SBRJâs (Rioâs domestic airport) 1,300 m runway. With the ever-increasing international demand, they finally built a passenger terminal, which was progressively expanded until 1977. A new terminal building was opened that year, and all scheduled passenger traffic was transferred there. Itâs still in use today as Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was first renovated in 1991 in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit (held in 1992), and its annual capacity increased to 7.5 million passengers. Eight years later, Terminal 2 was opened, featuring 24 jetways and a capacity of up to 7.5 million passengers per year. âWith the imminence of the World Cup and the Olympic Games in 2014 and 2016, respectively, Infraero (the airportâs former manager) unveiled a $431 million upgrade and expansion plan for GaleÃ£o, including the renovation of Terminal 1, the completion of Terminal 2, and the expansion of the parking lots. The new concessionary revised the plans and included a new pier with 26 jetways, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2640 parking spaces. The $400 million sum quickly jumped to $800 million instead. AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, Azul, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Flybondi, Gol, Iberia, ITA Airways, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, KLM, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Latam PerÃº, Lufthansa, Paranair, Sky Airlines, TAP, and United Airlines serve it.

Over the years, it has expanded and developed into what it is today. Currently, the airport features two parallel runways, three passenger terminals, a cargo terminal, and a 230-foot tall air traffic control tower. It serves as a hub for both Vietnam Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Company, as well as accommodating a variety of other airlines that provide flights from around the world. The V2 version of the scenery is packed with features, including PBR textures, dynamic lighting, realistic ground markings, custom jetways, and more. The newly released Tan Son Nhat International Airport by DominicDesignTeam is now available on SimMarket for approximately $26.17. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>XWind Studios Announces Long Beach Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. XWind Studios has recently announced the development of Long Beach Airport (KLGB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 4.1 million passengers. The airport was built on the same site as the worldâs first flight school (created in 1919 by Earl S. Daugherty), after he managed to convince the city council to transform the structure into a municipal airport in 1923. The passenger terminal building was built in 1941, designed by William Horace Austin and Kenneth Smith Wing.  During its first few decades of commercial operations, the only destinations were Los Angeles, San Diego, and Catalina Island. It wasnât until 1962 that the route network expanded to San Francisco, and eventually to Las Vegas and Oakland, with the advent of jet aircraft in the late 1960s. The early 1990s were disastrous for the airportâs traffic figures, with multiple airlines ending service to it. Further blows came in the early 2000s and mid-2010s, when American Airlines and Alaska Airlines ceased service, respectively. Itâs served by Delta Airlines, Delta Connection, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. â The developers claim to have spent the last nine months learning, researching, and working their way through the production of the scenery, which is approximately 70% complete and is expected to be released within the first quarter of the year. âIf you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
