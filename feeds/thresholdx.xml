    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Freeware developer Headwind Simulations has recently showcased a preview of the upcoming custom cockpit for its A339X project, in a video posted on the AviatorCro YouTube channel. Until now, the aircraft has had a cockpit based on the FlyByWire A32NX [...] According to Headwind, the footage presented does not feature a completely new model or a full A330 cockpit; however, it represents a significant improvement in quality. Several changes are immediately apparent, with the design and geometry of the main panel standing out as the most notable. It is no longer a "hybrid" between an A320 and an A330. Additionally, a third Multi-Function Control Display Unit (MCDU) has been added, and lighting controls have been fully integrated. Some systems have also been improved, such as adding the "north reference" feature, which allows for switching navigational reference from magnetic to true north. This update is Phase 1 and will not include a redesigned overhead panel, as that will be part of Phase 2. Headwind Simulations has also indicated that Phase 2 will be released once the necessary systems are in place.Â  The update is scheduled for release in January 2025 and will be exclusive to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for the time being. â For additional updates on the Headwind Simulations A339X, and more, stay tuned to Threshold.Â  Additionally, join our vibrant community on Discord!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Borgillios Scenery recently released their rendition of NorrkÃ¶ping Airport (ESSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves NorrkÃ¶ping and has a yearly average of 103,298 passengers.Â  Founded in 1934, NorrkÃ¶ping is Sweden's oldest commercial travel airport. Although mostly commercial throughout its history, the Swedish Air Forces briefly used it during World War 2.Â  The airport's traffic peaked in the 1980s, followed by a significant decline shortly afterward due to the rise of high-speed rail connections and the development of larger commercial airports.Â  Despite the challenges, efforts have been made to revitalize the airport and attract new airlines and routes. The airport's location in a strategically important region and its history and infrastructure offer potential for future growth and development. Nowadays, the airport only gets seasonal charter traffic from Braathens International Airways, Pegasus Airlines, and TUI fly Nordic. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, high-detail buildings (terminal, hangars, etc), and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $10.30, requiring at least 166.64 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. XWind Studios has recently launched its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024: Trenton-Mercer Airport (KTTN). Located in Trenton, the capital city of New Jersey, this airport is a hub for Frontier Airlines, serving approximately 600,000 passengers annually. Trenton-Mercer Airport's history dates back to 1907 when the first airplane landed on Alfred Reeder's field in Ewing. Skillman Airport opened to the public in 1929. During World War II, the local General Motors plant transitioned to manufacturing torpedo bombers, leading to airport expansions to accommodate test flights for these aircraft. The airport was later renamed Mercer County Airport and eventually became Trenton-Mercer Airport in 1995, linking it to the city of Trenton. In 1998, the airport replaced human weather observers with an automated weather system. Although the county plans to replace the old terminal, residents have opposed this idea. Today, Frontier Airlines is the only airline operating at the airport, offering flights to destinations such as Atlanta, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, and West Palm Beach. The newly released scenery hosts a range of features, including high-quality, optimized textures, detailed terminal interior designs, custom taxiway signage, comprehensive imagery of the entire airport, and much more. The scenery requires 3.95 GB of storage space and is available on the iniBuilds Store for $10.38. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned to Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PerfectSoft Studio has released its rendition of FÃ¨sâSaÃ¯ss Airport (GMFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Located in Morocco, it serves the city of Fez and connects various destinations across Europe, welcoming approximately 1.4 million passengers annually. FÃ¨sâSaÃ¯ss Airport is one of the busiest airports in Morocco. It aims to connect the region to Europe, a goal it has successfully achieved with a steady increase in flights. The airport reached the milestone of welcoming over one million passengers annually back in 2017. Operated by the Moroccan Airports Authority, it features a runway that is 10,500 feet long, capable of accommodating a variety of aircraft. The airport serves airlines such as Air Arabia and Ryanair, offering destinations like Amsterdam, Barcelona, Brussels, and many more. The newly released scenery features realistic modelling, PBR texturing, 4K textures, high-detail 3D models, and hand-placed vegetation, among other features. The scenery is available for around $15.41 on the SimMarket. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published their first development update of the year, which includes further information on the progress of porting their current product line over to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, their upcoming 777-200ER, and more. They are still waiting for Asobo to address specific issues with MSFS 2024 that seem to be blocking the conversion for the time being (memory allocation issues, instability, etc). They have forwarded their findings to the development team and hope these fixes will be made available by SU1.Â  While they hope that SU1 will allow them to work with MSFS 2024, they are not entirely optimistic yet: âIn our experience, there is still downside risk that getting these two fixes rolled into the platform might simply move us forward a few spots, so that we can crack our shins on the next obstacle,â explained Randazzo. The plans for product line compatibility remain similar, with the DC-6 being made compatible yet not bringing any new features per se, the triple sevens eventually making their way into the new platform, and the 737 is undergoing a major overhaul with new sim features such as walkaround, career mode features, upgraded textures, new models, a brand new cabin with a working cockpit door, enhanced gameplay features and interactivity within the cabin environment, and new sounds.Â  The 737 will also receive an update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which aims to fix the spinning logo bug on the Universal Flight Tablet. Their upcoming 777-200ER is entering beta testing, and PMDG plans to release it for MSFS 2020 and 2024 (like the 777F). Due to the existing workload, no new features are planned for the product. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.
