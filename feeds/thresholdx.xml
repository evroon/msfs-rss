    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Rowsfire has recently launched the pre-sale for their upcoming B107 Boeing 737 Overhead Panel, with an attractive discount for early pre-orderers (up to $140 off). With a mainboard crafted using SMT PCB technology, it’s built to ensure a long lifespan and overall reliability, bringing the experience of fiddling with the switches on a Boeing 737’s overhead panel to the comfort of your home.  With a 4mm-thick, scratch-resistant acrylic front panel, Rowsfire’s overhead is designed to conveniently fit on many desks and home cockpit layouts.  On the software side of things, it’s operated by MobiFlight in tandem with Rowsfire’s own app, working right out of the box with PMDG, and support is also planned for iFly, Zibo, and Laminar Research's default 738.  Furthermore, the overhead panel does not require any external power; it relies on a single USB-A cable to function. The overhead is available for pre-order on their website, starting at $559.99 (for pre-orders until Jan 25), then $599.99 (for pre-orders until Feb 1st), and finally $699.99, the original retail price. Free worldwide shipping is included. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! ‍</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDG has recently released its rendition of N'djili Airport (FZAA) for X-Plane 12. The airport, located in the capital city of Kinshasa, is the largest airport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The airport was opened in 1959 and was initially used primarily by the airline SABENA. However, by 1960, it became a major hub for Air Congo following the independence of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The airport was a central battleground during the Second Congo War in 1998. In 2015, a new international terminal was opened, increasing the airport's capacity to accommodate one million passengers annually. Today, the airport serves a variety of airlines, including Brussels Airlines, Compagnie Africaine d’Aviation, Congo Airways, and Qatar Airways, providing connections to destinations around the world. The newly released scenery features an accurate depiction of N'djili Airport, along with detailed models, dynamic lighting, reflective textures, and much more. The newly released N'djili Airport is now available from FSDG for approximately $19.93. ‍ For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! ‍ If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Zero Dollar Payware has recently released their rendition of Helo Keany Heliport (65NJ) for X-Plane 12, one of the largest North American heliports with almost 30 helipads. The largest vertical-lift facility on the entire East Coast is a premier FBO that bridges the gap between New Jersey’s logistics hubs and Manhattan’s skyscraper-laden skyline.  Located only two minutes away (flying time, of course) from Manhattan, it’s an ideal staging ground for corporate shuttles, news crews, and tourism operators who need immediate access to the city without the operational hurdles - and costs - of landing directly in Manhattan’s public heliports.  ZDP’s rendition recreates the area with very high fidelity, including all 29 helipads, 5 fuel pads, and a transit pad. Furthermore, it also includes a few static helicopters provided by Jetset.  It’s available for free on Threshold, requiring at least 21.41 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has just released the first official trailer for its upcoming Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. iniBuilds is recreating one of the world’s busiest aviation hubs, capturing the immense scale of Dallas Fort Worth with its five terminals, complex taxiway network, elevated bridges, and surrounding infrastructure. Built natively for MSFS 2024, the scenery makes use of the latest SDK features, with a strong emphasis on performance, despite the airport’s sheer size. The newly released trailer highlights many of the airport’s defining elements, including the fully modelled and animated Skylink Air Train system, extensive apron areas, and detailed terminal architecture.  iniBuilds has confirmed a comprehensive feature set, including over 180 custom models, bespoke ground textures, up-to-date airport layout data, detailed dynamic lighting, HD jetways, accurate taxi signage, and an official GSX profile. Level of Detail optimisation has been applied across to ensure smooth performance, even during peak traffic scenarios. Scenery Features: While no release date or pricing has been announced, iniBuilds says Dallas Fort Worth is “coming soon,” with content creators and streamers expected to receive early access ahead of launch.  We’ll keep you updated.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Coleman A. Young International Airport (KDET) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Detroit, Michigan, with a yearly average of 32,850 passengers. It opened as Detroit City Airport Terminal in 1927, designed by architect Perry A. Fellows and built by W. E. Wood Co., after five years of searching for an adequate location and carrying on the necessary construction work.  Two years later, the administration built the first hangar, and it quickly rose into Detroit’s main airport at the time. It was Detroit’s main airport until 1947, when Wayne County Metropolitan Airport took over the majority of the flights. That happened in large part because Detroit City Airport couldn’t be expanded further due to a cemetery in the vicinity, which local residents did not agree to demolishing. Traffic kept on dying over the years, with airline service completely ending in 2000 and the airport’s focus shifting over to pilot training and handling private/corporate flights.  The FAA has recently approved a plan to improve the airport’s infrastructure - the first in 30 years - which should theoretically unlock more than 100 million USD in federal funds over the next decade, allowing the administration to work on a new control tower, improved taxiways, and a regulation-compliant safety zone. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-crafted custom assets, custom ground textures, PBR texturing, fully modeled interiors, custom night lighting, and much more. It’s available on OrbxDirect for roughly $13.83, requiring at least 2.77 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Paulo Ricardo has recently released their rendition of Recife/Guararapes—Gilberto Freyre International Airport (SBRF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, with an average of 9 million passengers per year. It was built during World War 2 to replace an airfield at the same location. In the years following the conflict, it became a strategic technical and refueling stop on routes from South America to Europe. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1958, and its two runways were extended at the time to accommodate larger aircraft. In the late 1970s, an agreement was reached with Infraero (a state-owned airport operator) to further develop the airport, leading to renovations in 1982 and expansion work in the 1990s. A new passenger terminal, including a shopping mall and a concourse, was built in 2004, increasing its passenger handling capacity from 1.5 million a year to 9 million. In late 2009, the government invested 8 million BRL into upgrading the terminal for the 2014 World Cup, adding eight more jetways and modernizing the infrastructure. It’s a hub for Azul Linhas Aéreas and is served by Gol Linhas Aéreas, LATAM Brasil, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas Aéreas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a highly detailed passenger terminal with a partially modeled interior, city landmarks, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. ​ It’s available in the Marketplace (2020 and 2024) for $11.99.

    <title>Kiss Simulation Releases Sarajevo International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <link href="/news/kissar24"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Kiss Simulation has recently released their updated rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and averaging 1.3 million passengers a year. It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations began a year later, with Frankfurt as its first international destination.  The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements. The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building capable of handling up to 2 million passengers a year. Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, most notably in December 2015, when over 40% of flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that it’s already relatively short at 2,600 meters.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, including the new terminal extension, a custom runway profile, a real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more. It’s available on SimMarket for $15.50, requiring at least 1.75 GB of free hard disk space. Owners of the 2020 version are entitled to a free upgrade.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Tweed-New Haven Regional Airport (KHVN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving New Haven and the New York Metropolitan Area, with an average of 1.1 million passengers per year. The airport opened for traffic in late 1931 as New Haven Municipal Airport. Li-Con Airways Incorporated and American Airlines were the first to commercially serve the then brand-new airport in 1933 and 1934, respectively. While Li-Con’s service lasted only a year, American Airlines’ route between Boston, New Haven, and New York lasted nearly three decades. Allegheny Airlines and Allegheny Commuter took over after American Airlines ended regularly scheduled service, operating BAC One-Eleven jets until the mid-1970s.  In the late 1970s, New Haven Airways kicked off their scheduled flights, becoming New Haven’s hometown airline - NewAir -, operating flights to New York (JFK and La Guardia), Philadelphia, Baltimore/Washington Intl, and Washington National with their fleet of de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, and Short 360s. NewAir’s operations were relatively short-lived, with operations ending in 1985. After the mid-1980s, regularly scheduled service started declining massively, with airlines starting and quickly ending operations in New Haven. It wasn’t until the 2010s that New Haven would see renewed activity. In late 2024, the airport received $ 4 million to build a new passenger terminal, aiming to replace the previous one, built nearly a century ago, with modern facilities, almost 8,000 square meters of area, and greatly improving the airport’s passenger handling capabilities. There are also plans to expand the runway. Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways are the only two airlines currently serving the airport. The scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom terminal and airport buildings, high-resolution PBR ground textures, a detailed apron, realistic night lighting, and performance-friendly optimization. It’s available in the iniBuilds Store for roughly $9.64, requiring at least 3.36 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (KBHM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Birmingham, Alabama, with an average of 3.2 million passengers per year, making it the largest and busiest airport in the state. The airport opened in early 1931 with a single east-west runway and a two-story passenger terminal. The airport was leased to the United States Army Air Forces for $1 a year during World War 2 to support national defense, becoming Birmingham Army Airfield. The period under the US Army’s helm brought several improvements, such as new paved taxiways, a new control tower, and the construction of an aircraft modification center. Despite Birmingham being considered a potential air transportation hub for the American South, an aviation fuel tax imposed by the city made it financially unfeasible for many operators, leading Atlanta to become the preferred choice instead. ​ The airport played an important role during the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, with pilots and crew from the Alabama National Air Guard selected to train Cuban exile fliers in Nicaragua to fly the Douglas B-26 Invader.  ​ A second passenger terminal was built in 1962 to accommodate the ever-growing passenger figures, along with a new control tower.  ​ Then, a new semi-circular terminal was completed in 1973 with 15 aircraft gates and a large parking deck.  ​ Between 1970 and 1992, a slow demolition process began to completely demolish the original passenger terminal built in 1931. The 1990s brought multiple runway expansions to accommodate larger aircraft. ​ In 2011, the administration approved a new three-phase terminal modernization project, demolishing the old terminal from 1962, the semi-circular terminal from 1973, and constructing new facilities with 19 gates, doubling the airport’s footprint. It’s served by American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released a landmark pack for Perth (Australia), designed to complement their new Perth International Airport (YPPH) airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The comprehensive pack aims to bring Perth to life with its vibrant skyline, adding hand-crafted custom models to further improve the experience when flying in and out of Perth International. There are over 40 custom-modeled buildings around the city, along with improvements to vegetation, better object placement (buildings, bridges, static boats, vessels, and cranes), custom night lighting around Elizabeth Quay, an airstrip at Langley Park for landings in the city centre, and much more. It’s available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.56, requiring at least 2.55 GB of free hard disk space to install. There’s also a bundle with the landmarks pack and Perth airport, offering a 10% discount.  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! ‍</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently shared a couple of new screenshots of their upcoming Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, set to release soon.  DFW is the third-busiest airport in the world, with an average of 82 million passengers per year. As expected from such figures, the airport’s size is quite substantial, and not many developers have tried to tackle it in the past.  iniBuilds claims to have captured every corner of the airport, bringing an incredible hub experience to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, custom high-definition jetways, a high-resolution ground poly, performance-friendly optimization, over 180 hand-crafted models, custom ground service equipment, and much more. There’s no pricing or release date yet, but iniBuilds says it’s “coming soon”. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! ‍</summary>
