    <title>SimulaciÃ³n Extrema Releases Kirkwall Airport for MSFS </title>
    <updated>2024-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/sexkir"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6764c1e654f2be63857ec790_kirk1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their rendition of Kirkwall Airport (EGPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves the Orkney Islands in Scotland and has a yearly average of 143,000 passengers. Built in 1940 as RAF Grimsetter to defend the Scapa Flow Naval base, taking its name from the homonymous farm it was built over.Â  Three years later, the Royal Navy took over and renamed it Royal Naval Air Station Grimsetter. Control was passed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in 1948 and handed over to an administration company in the mid-1980s, ultimately ending its military roles. Nowadays, Kirkwall Airport serves as a vital connection between the Orkney Islands and the mainland, operating services to Aberdeen, Belfast City, Dundee, Ebay, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, London Heathrow, Manchester, North Ronaldsay, Papa Westray, Sanday, Stronsay, Sumburgh, and Westray through Loganair, which is the only airline serving the airport as of 2024. The airport is home to the Sustainable Aviation Test Environment (SATE), the United Kingdomâs first low-carbon aviation test center. It is helping to pave aviationâs future one test flight at a time. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D-modeled terminal, custom landside buildings and hangars, custom ground textures, custom runway textures, a custom interior, and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $11.99 and is currently compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Once the in-sim marketplace is launched, an MSFS 2024 exclusive version will be available. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Just Flight recently published a new development update on the upcoming Airbus A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, showcasing the night lighting logic in the flight deck and addressing its compatibility with MSFS 2024. The developers are finishing work on the animation and lighting logic for nearly two thousand switches, dials, and annunciator lights. This process required coding each element, verifying its operability within the simulator, and tweaking the animations or artwork further when needed.Â  Their systems coders have made great progress over the last 18 months. They will soon be able to âbring the aircraft to lifeâ as the cockpit artwork and animations are ready. They look forward to sharing systems previews early next year. The exterior has not been previewed yet because it is undergoing work on refining its overall geometry, adding extra details such as panels, lines, wiring around the landing gear, and a detailed cargo hold, to name a few. The modeling has recently reached completion, and texturing is now underway, with previews to come in 2025. Similarly to their upcoming Fokkers, core development will remain on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for now while they wait for greater stability. The commitment to support both simulators remains.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently launched the trailer for their upcoming Airbus A350 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, along with a comprehensive development update listing some of its features and shedding light on a potential release date. As previously covered, iniBuilds decided to make it compatible with 2020 due to stability and reliability issues with Microsoftâs new flight simulator, thus investing in two development cycles under a single purchase and allowing the freedom of platform choice. âWe will do our very best to have parity in feature sets between both versions of the aircraft, but please note this will not be possible all the way, and more details will be shared close to release,â they conclude. The feature list promises a detailed 3D cabin with a cabin announcement system, a comprehensive flight attendant panel, custom terrain radar, detailed systems simulation, Navigraph integration with SimBrief import feature, a situation manager, ABEAM &amp; Offset simulation, intricate 3D model and texturing, GPS jamming, multiple failures, Brake-to-Vacate, and structural vibrations.Â  They claim to have worked very hard to provide a top-tier simulation of its electrical parts and systems, with a full-fledged electrical bus simulation, dynamic load computation, distinct battery options (NiCad or Lithium, with varying capacities and amperage), and noise-optimized N1 settings for NADP procedures. iniBuilds will be commencing their usual Aircraft showcase series on YouTube within the next few weeks, walking people through some of these new features. While the A350 was originally set to be released in 2024, iniBuilds has made the difficult decision to postpone the release to Q1 2025 to warrant a âfantastic product on launch.â Both variants will be available on day one, and the XLR will come at a later date.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently launched its version of Oulu Airport (EFOU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport, located approximately 6.6 miles from the city center of Oulu, Finland, welcomes around 550.000 passengers each year and handles nearly 6.000 aircraft movements. The airport opened in 1953, following the commencement of construction in 1949. Initially, the airport featured only gravel runways. This changed in 1958 when the runways were paved, and the airport received its terminal and air traffic control (ATC) building. In 1973, the current terminal building replaced the earlier structure, which was later demolished in 2005. The terminal underwent further expansion and renovation in 2002 and 2011. Regarding the runways, the second runway was removed in 2000, shortly after the completion of the current ATC tower in 1998. Today, the airport operates flights from Finnair, Lufthansa, and Aegean Airlines, offering various regular and charter destinations, including Helsinki, Munich, Chania, and Rhodes. The scenery package is filled with features including custom night lighting, custom parking positions, custom surroundings, custom people, PBR materials, and much more. The add-on requires slightly over 1 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for $17.16. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

The highlights for the update are below: DMC Systems Improvements: FWC:Â  ATSU:Â  Sound Enhancements: Simconnect Hardware FSLabs will continue the sound work through the holidays, as they are aware that some issues still exist. However, they wanted to provide part of the ongoing work with this update to gather feedback and eventually warrant a polished result. The add-on is available on their website for $69.95.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries has recently launched its latest scenery for X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12: Iloilo International Airport (RPVI). As the fifth busiest airport in the Philippines, Iloilo International Airport welcomes over 2.3 million passengers each year. Commercial traffic at the airport began in 2007, serving as a replacement for the former Mandurriao Airport. Although it did not operate as a commercial airport before 2007, the site of the current airport has been involved in various aviation activities since 1942. During World War II, an airfield was constructed in 1942. After the war, this airfield gradually transitioned into a civilian airport, accommodating both military and general aviation traffic. Over the years, the airport underwent several changes and construction projects before commencing commercial operations in 2007. â Today, the airport serves airlines such as Cebu Pacific and PAL Express, offering flights to destinations including Cebu, Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong, and many others. Airwil Sceneries' depiction of the airport boasts numerous features, including hundreds of custom-made objects, a modeled interior of the passenger terminal, a modeled interior of the control tower, and more. The scenery requires 1.99 GB of storage space and is now available at SimMarket for approximately $11.46. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Plane 12.1.3 has just been fully released, one and a half months after the first beta release. ATC, the user interface, and sounds are among the most improved aspects of this update. â ATC and sounds According to Laminar Research, the ATC system has undergone a significant overhaul. Radio communications have become much more realistic, including features such as radio checks, clearance requests, and VFR and IFR procedures that support SIDs and STARs. Additionally, the default navigation data has been updated to AIRAC 2306. Users can now copy and paste routes from tools like Navigraph and Simbrief directly into their flight plans. They can also request alternative SIDs and STARs, ask for altitude exceptions, and receive per-turn instructions. Furthermore, X-Plane can now be configured to output ATC audio to a separate audio device. Weather A full weather update is planned, but some changes have been made in version 12.1.3. Issues with sudden altitude and pressure changes during mid flight have been resolved. Additionally, improvements have been made to cloud visualization and interpreting METAR information and wind data. Errors related to the NEXRAD display for document number G1000 have also been addressed. User interface The flight configuration menu now provides more detailed information about gates and ramps. Additionally, the map highlights active runways and shows taxi routes. Several smaller improvements have also been made, including fixing rendering stutters that occurred when displaying UI elements and ensuring that VR windows maintain their positions. X-Plane identity In preparation for the X-Plane Store, the X-Plane identity feature has been released in early access. This feature allows you to link your purchase key to your X-Plane identity. Once you complete the migration, your X-Plane key will no longer be necessary; a simple login will grant you access to the simulator. In the future, purchases from the X-Plane Store will be linked to your X-Plane identity. According to Laminar Research, migrating to X-Plane identity is entirely optional. Several other changes have been implemented, including a handcrafted overhaul of The Downtown Manhattan Heliport (KJRB) and enhancements to the default A330, Cirrus SR22, and Cessna Citation X. â The full list of changes can be found on X-Plane.com. â Version 12.1.4, âThe Flightlessons Updateâ is next up. â For more on that, and more, stay tuned to Threshold.
