    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently issued a new experimental update to their A321ceo and ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, focusing on increasing stability, improving visual performance, and improving the handling, among other things. Update v11.0.1.309 aims to improve performance and lower VRAM usage, ensuring better headroom for users running very high resolutions or rocking cards with little VRAM to spare. Such extra headroom should warrant better stability in video memory-constrained environments, like approaching a demanding airport on top of a photogrammetric area. They have also mitigated certain CTDs that occasionally happen with very specific TCAS traffic situations and aircraft reloads. The steps taken to mitigate those should increase the overall robustness of their code, making it much more reliable. FSLabs has also worked on correcting an issue affecting the yaw behavior during the landing roll and retuning brake effectiveness based on measured stopping distances from real aircraft. These tweaks should bring more authenticity to the post-touchdown phase. â Systems were also improved, with FMGC protections added, further improvements to the NEO engine logic, ROPS behavior, and many smaller fixes.Â  â The complete changelog follows below: AOC Service:Â  â â APU: â â CIDS: â ELAC: â FMGC: â â FWC:Â  â â MCDU: â â Neo-specific: â â ROPS: â â Systems Improvements: â â Model Updates: â â The A321ceo and neo are available in their store for $69.95 each.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Horizon Simulations has shared a comprehensive development update on its freeware Boeing 787 project for MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, detailing some of the big improvements of the upcoming Version 2. Acknowledging a period of silence, Horizon Simulations explained that the team is entirely volunteer-based, balancing development with personal obligations. As a result, they avoid setting deadlines. However, they plan to share regular content updates moving forward, including monthly posts and in-depth âdevelopment divesâ, highlighting features of the upcoming Version 2 release. Version 2 of the Horizon 787 will feature a major overhaul for all three variants, the 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10, with a focus on a significantly revised external model. Other enhancements include a new custom cabin and numerous visual and functional refinements. Among the key upgrades are accurately modelled CAC inlet doors that respond dynamically to environmental, hydraulic and engine conditions, as well as support for line number variations that reflect subtle real-world differences between each airframe. Engine animations have also been redesigned, with revised spool-up dynamics and improved visual effects between the Trent 1000 and GEnx powerplants. Other notable additions include a functioning APU door, a reworked vertical stabiliser, new lighting with shadow effects for more realistic reflections, and detailed control surface behaviour when hydraulic power is not available, including aileron, flaperon, and elevator droop, along with rudder deflection induced by wind. While the update does not provide a release timeline, Horizon Simulations emphasised that development is active and ongoing. Further details, including sounds, systems, and additional model improvements, are expected in future posts. For all the latest in flight simulation, be sure to stay updated here on Threshold!

    <title>X-Codr Designs Updates Living Scenery Technology to Version 1.12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Living Scenery Technology, a free ground traffic plugin for XP11 and XP12, has recently been updated to version 1.12. The release introduces several new features and fixes, aimed at improving realism and flexibility for developers.  Designed to animate moving objects within sceneries, such as people, cars, and ground traffic, the plugin provides a versatile system for developers to create dynamic environments. Among the most notable additions is the "MINSPACING" command, which enables developers to set a minimum distance between vehicles on a route. Vehicles now decelerate gradually and stop if they get too close, simulating traffic jams and stoplights more accurately. Support for dataref operations has also been further improved, with an optional priority system. This resolves previous conflicts when multiple operations targeted the same dataref, allowing for more controlled animations, such as preventing vehicles from driving through occupied crosswalks, or managing door behaviour based on other traffic conditions. The update also further refines acceleration and deceleration logic. Rather than stopping and starting abruptly, vehicles now adjust speed smoothly based on waypoint conditions, resulting in more believable traffic flow. Additionally, version 1.12 introduces the âDREFCYCLEâ command, which cycles a dataref through a specified pattern, ideal for features like animated jetways.  The update is available for download via X-Plane.org. Be sure to stay up to date with all the latest flight simulation news, right here on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently released their rendition of S43 Harvey Field and W16 Monroe Firstair for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which improves on the 2020 version. Harvey Airfield is a privately-owned public-use airport in Snohomish (WA), categorized on the FAA's National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a regional reliever facility. It was established in 1944 by the Harvey Family, getting a restaurant, an administration building, and a maintenance shop in 1947.Â  It is mainly used for flight training in general aviation airplanes and helicopters, and offers fuel and aircraft maintenance. Monroe First Air Field is a public-use airport owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. It opened in 1930 as a private airfield for Monroe Aircraft Corporation and was utilized in the following decade as a training base for the US Army.Â  The post-war period saw the airfield become a general aviation facility, which continues to this day, even after it was acquired by the Washington State Department of Transportation in 1980. Despite being small, it's considered a very important part of the state's history for its many purposes over its nearly 100 years of existence. The scenery features a reedition of a FSX/P3D classic ported initially to 2020 and now revamped for 2024 in its full glory, with dynamic night lighting, full PBR UHD texturing, high-detailed models, and more. It's available on OrbxDirect for roughly $16.40, requiring at least 4.62 GB of free hard disk space to install (owners of the 2020 version get it for free).

    <title>Fly 2 High Releases Tulsa International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Tulsa International Airport (KTUL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Tulsa, Oklahoma, and has a yearly average of 3.2 million passengers. The airport opened nearly a hundred years ago, in 1928, as Tulsa Municipal Airport. Its initial infrastructure was rather rough, with a one-story wood and tar âterminalâ and landing strips and taxiways made of mown grass. It was busy enough at the time to be the âbusiest airport in the World,â handling nearly 10,000 passengers a month, somehow outpacing Croydon Airport in London, Berlin Tempelhof, and Paris Le Bourget. In the early 1930s, Frederick Kershner designed a new terminal with an elegant Art Deco design, no more wood and tar. That building soldiered on until the 1950s, when the administration realized it was no longer sufficient for the traffic figures, leading to the construction of a new terminal in 1958. The new â and much bigger â terminal opened in 1961, qualifying it to become an International airport two years later. It hosted the 130th Fighter Wing in 1940 during the early stages of World War 2. Within a year of that, the War Department determined that Tulsa would become the site of an Air Force Plant, operated by Douglas Aircraft Corporation to manufacture and assemble bombers from 1942 to 1945. A year after the war, American Airlines purchased two ex-Air Force hangars to start their maintenance facilities in Tulsa, where they had nonstop routes to Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the 1960s, McDonnell Douglas still used the Air Force Plant for aircraft maintenance. The lease ended in 1996, when Boeing acquired it for aerospace manufacturing. The passenger terminal was renovated in the 2010s, designed by Gensler and Benham Companies. The ceilings were raised, passenger waiting areas were improved, and the gates were redesigned. Itâs a hub for Omni Air International and Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a high-quality terminal model and its respective interior, custom jetways, custom taxiway labels, custom ground markings, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket (2020 / 2024) for roughly $21.63, requiring at least 2.87 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Career progression is guided by performance across scheduled flights, with players earning cash, XP, and skill points to unlock new abilities, lifestyle improvements, and boost well-being, factors that influence job effectiveness. The application features three distinct game modes: Career Mode, where you build an airline career with generated routes and weekly schedules; Free Play Mode, which offers access to all features from the start, and Schedule Mode, focusing solely on realistic schedules and immersive flying, without the progression mechanics. You can create up to eight personalised pilot profiles and 16 aircraft profiles, each with its own schedules and data. Route generation is based on real-world airline data, and offers short- to medium-haul sectors, ranging from 30 minutes to around six hours. The software also includes dynamic diversions, sightseeing flights, side jobs, and a progression system that unlocks over 30 pilot skills. Lifestyle upgrades, such as home furnishings and sim pit setups, appear in a 3D-rendered home environment. Each flight is logged in a logbook, detailing performance metrics and feedback on landing quality, as well as other parameters. You can also create a custom airline, using any aircraft. Fly the Line is available from the Just Flight store for $39.99 USD. The program comes with an installer and includes built-in tutorials.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimWorks Studios has recently issued a development update on social media, outlining progress across several ongoing projects, including the GA8 Airvan, PC-12, and FS2024 upgrades for the Kodiak series. Firstly, the developer stated that the MSFS 2020 version of the GA8 Airvan is nearing release, with the developer confirming that initial copies have already been distributed to ten users, ahead of launch. The MSFS 2024 variant is currently feature-complete; however, its release has been deferred by approximately one month to allow for additional testing following the rollout of Sim Update 3. Accompanying documentation, including the aircraft manual and a failures supplement for the SystemsPulse system, will be published next week, alongside the product page of the GA8. SimWorks Studios also stated that the Airvan will be released via the Microsoft Marketplace to begin with, with a direct store launch planned for a later date. The developer also shared updates on the Pilatus PC-12. The interior model rework has been completed, and is now entering the testing phase. In addition to improving FS2024 compatibility, the updated model features adapted Level of Detail (LOD) variants for better performance and reduced file size. The new cabin has seamless textures and enhanced customisability, allowing for more detailed liveries. Work on the PC-12 exterior model is expected to begin next week, with a teaser of the NG variant planned at a later date. SimWorks Studios is also working to enable hot-swapping between avionics configurations, the GNS, GTN and GTNXi, using the tablet system from the Airvan, which will be ported over to the PC-12. In closing, the developer noted continued progress on making both the Kodiak 100 and 900 compatible with MSFS 2024, with more news expected soon.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations recently published a 30-minute video showcasing some of the upcoming changes that will accompany the so-called Big Fenix Update, which is set to release on Tuesday or Wednesday. The changes include a complete rework of the landing behavior, using over 800,000 real-life landings from different A320 family aircraft, spanning their entire lineup (A319/A320/A321), the addition of the A319SL, a rare variant of the A319 only operated by a few airlines around the world, an entirely reworked cockpit for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 version, making use of its new lighting engine, and an interactive walkaround mode (also 2024 only), among many other tweaks and fixes. Furthermore, their A320 lineup will feature a working weather radar â only missing the tilt feature due to a sim limitation â, LIDO charts support (2024), sound improvements, and become less reliant on the Prosim base. Fenixâs A320 lineup is available on their website for $120.90 (complete bundle), or $67.17 (A320 only) + $53.73 (A319+A321).Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations today released the longâanticipated, aptly nicknamed âBig Fenix Updateâ, a sweeping overhaul of the entire A320 family, for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update delivers full MSFS 2024 support, major flight-model enhancements, and a range of system, livery, art, and EFB improvements. The update introduces full FS2024ânative modular SimObject support and rendering updates, along with new engine models, as well as the new A319 Sharklet variant, with custom performance data. The flight deck has been remodelled and retextured for MSFS 2024, complete with reworked display rendering, new soundsets, and a revamped livery manager featuring dozens of new liveries. Landing dynamics and flyâbyâwire responsiveness have been retuned, with ground law, elevator deflection, AoA protection and Î±MAX handling improved across all variants. Flex temp unlatching logic, OP CLB/DES behaviour, and Flight Director pitch response in normal flight have all been refined. Performance has also been improved through reduced CPU load and optimised display rendering. A new LOD-system has also been implemented for all models, bringing further optimization. Flight model enhancements focus on improved groundâlaw behaviour, AoA protection, and refined handling characteristics across all variants. Autopilot pitch response, flex temp logic, and Open Climb/Descent behaviour have also been reworked. Furthermore, Wingflex has also seen further improvement. The update introduces full support for MSFS 2024âs walkaround mode, with interactive cargo doors, chocks, power panels, engine fanblades and refuelling controls. Automatic connection of stairs and door opening on spawn-in has been added. New configuration options in the EFB allow control over ADIRS type, ACP style and ISIS display preferences. The update also brings support for the MSFS weather-radar, which is now fully implemented, within simulator limitations. Furthermore, the update includes various visual upgrades such as new cabin lighting, a new native iridescent windshield material, microscratches and refined glass decals for MSFS 2024. New sounds have been added to doors, cooling fans and avionics contactors, amongst others. A completely new IAE engine sound set is also included, with windmilling effects.Â  Walkaround mode now supports insideâoutside sound transitions and even avatar walking noises, though collisions may still cause occasional jitter. A brandânew native EFB chart app is featured, with LIDO support and an option to switch between simulator and Navigraph sources. Pilot Brief PDF viewing, custom refuelling rates, takeâoff performance tools with ACT count, chart annotations and automatic switching of weight units when importing from SimBrief are included.Â The EFB also now works in walkaround-mode.  For a further deep dive into flight model and flyâbyâwire behaviour, an unlisted video on Fenixâs official YouTube channel offers detailed insight into control input processing and control surface responses.  You can watch it here.
