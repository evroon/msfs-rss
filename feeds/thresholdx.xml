    <summary>Sim: FS24. PhotoRico has recently released their rendition of Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024. The airport serves the municipality of San Juan in Puerto Rico and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers. Constructed by the US Navy in 1929 as Naval Station Isla Grande, it served as Puerto Ricoâs main international gateway until 1954, when it was ultimately replaced by Isla Verde International Airport. All international airlines moved there shortly after. The airportâs future was questioned a few times in the early 2000s, but a definitiveâfavorableâdecision was eventually reached in 2006 due to its key function as a primary reliever for Puerto Ricoâs main airport. In early 2011, the airportâs future went through another scare: the FAA wanted to close the airportâs control tower because they operated it themselves and intended to cut costs. Air Flamenco, Fly the Whale, M&amp;N Aviation, and Vieques Air Link regularly serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail buildings, custom ground textures, detailed landside, real static GA aircraft, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.70, requiring at least 873.59 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Orbx Releases Sandane Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/orbsan"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67b179b7fc990e8699d30e42_sandane1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently released their rendition of Sandane Airport (ENSD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the village of Sandane in Norway and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers.Â  The airport was built in the early 1970s and opened in 1975, then the only airport serving the district of Nordfjord. Due to its geography and low regularity, its initial years were plagued by severe turbulence, which was eventually partially mitigated in the following decades by a terminal expansion and a runway extension. The regularity issue was addressed relatively recently by installing navigation systems, ultimately reducing the canceled flights to a mere 5% in 2022. Its pre-ILS days were rather grim, with airplanes often dealing with low visibility, extreme winds, and insufficient runway. Itâs served by WiderÃ¸e, which has obligatory public service flights to Bergen, Oslo, and Sogndal, flown with Dash 8-100 airplanes. The Norwegian government subsidizes all of the routes. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 2K PBR textures, custom ground decals, crisp orthoimagery, custom approach lighting and ground equipment, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $11.97, requiring at least 842.51 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Salvuz Releases Bergen Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/salbgn"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67b22a23c1e0ca1d9b332a9c_bgn1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Salvuz recently released their rendition of Bergen Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It is the second busiest airport in Norway, with a yearly average of 6 million passengers. Dating back to the early 1950s, Bergen Airport was partially funded by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana with 4 million Norwegian kroner, securing the construction of a terminal and a 1,460-meter-long runway. NATO funded an expansion in 1953, warranting a 2,440-meter-long runway instead. When the first flight landed at the airport in mid-1954, only 800 meters were complete. It was a chartered flight from Bergen to Oslo, transporting a local football team. Itâs a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e, with an extensive domestic and intra-European network. According to 2014 data, Scandinavian Airlines had 46% of the market share for domestic flights, Norwegian had 38%, and WiderÃ¸e 15%. Internationally, Norway led the way with 36%, SAS with 23%, and KLM with 18% (with a single route to Amsterdam).Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed buildings, high-resolution PBR textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date layout (as of 2024), and it also supports MSFS 24âs new lighting and LOD system. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.85, requiring at least 1.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmd216"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67007455f9c93f4f4c4607ef_randy4.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a new development update concerning the status of their product lines for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, including further information on the upcoming 777-200ER and the 747 Classic project. The upcoming 777-200ERâs beta testing phase has finally started. The plane will feature all three engine variants (GE, RR, and PW) with their correct performance figures, indications, and sounds.Â  â While there is no timeline for the beta testing phase to end, Randazzo suspects they will have a better feel for the qualitative state of the product in the next 7-10 days. â Like the 777F, the 777-200ER will be available for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 first, with a 2024 version to be released later. â PMDG has also announced a new Operations Center (3.0), which is currently under beta testing as well and will eventually replace their current Operations Center, sporting a fresh new look, the ability to manage all product installations from within it, update management, rollbacks, and multiple channels (stable, experimental, beta, streamer builds). It will also handle activation and install rights and significantly improve PMDGâs ability to diagnose and resolve any problems that might occur with their products at hand.Â  Furthermore, the new Operations Center will eliminate the need for installers, which used to be one of their biggest choke points during product releases. â Itâs scheduled to roll out soon and coexist with 2.0 until they are wholly comfortable with the new methods. â Regarding the status of the 777âs conversion to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, PMDG has managed to build its lineup inside the new platform with great success, but some stability issues were found that would ultimately break the experience.Â  Despite the slightly underwhelming results, PMDG remains optimistic that their ârelationshipâ with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will improve as Asobo updates the platform. â On the other hand, the DCâ6â which they assumed would be an easy conversionâhas proven to be one of the trickiest, with numerous problems with the animations (including cockpit controls, levers, buttons, and other items). They have been unable to determine what is causing the problem so far. â They have reported the issue in Asoboâs dev community forums, but it appears to have not caught their attention yet, and no other developer has encountered anything similar. In light of this, PMDG has provided no ETA for its eventual conversion to the new platform. â 737NG-wise, they have not yet evaluated it in the new platform, as they are using the 777 as a testbed to learn the ropes. As for the upgrade pricing, PMDGâs position remains the same: while they ideally do not want to charge, they might have to charge depending on the amount of work required (they havenât fully gauged how much effort will be necessary yet). â Work on the 747 fleet has been accelerating while everything else remains relatively stagnant due to the compatibility stalemate. Randazzo reiterates that things are still moving, though slowly.Â  â While the 747-400 doesnât have any images yet, they have shared two pictures of the flight deck work on the 747-100, showcasing the newly started labeling work, custom weathering, etc.Â  Coding is also progressing nicely, with PMDG taking full advantage of the âstalemateâ to move developers on and off the 747. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their official website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99 If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Parallel 42 Publishes Deep Dive Video on Upcoming ChasePlane for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 recently published a video on their YouTube channel showcasing ChasePlaneâs onboarding tutorial. The video walks you through setting up all the necessary items to get the best experience and provides further information on the optional community access. The 10-minute video covers the entirety of the introductory steps, walking you through removing your bindings in Microsoft Flight Simulator (ChasePlane âkidnapsâ the camera system), configuring your bindings, setting up different camera presets, enabling cinematics, and sharing views with the community. â Itâs important to note thatâunlike Flow, one of their best-selling products for MSFSâcloud storage canât be provided for free, as it takes significantly more space. Therefore, they have chosen to make the cost optional, lowering the productâs final price tag and allowing customers to decide whether they want to pay extra for community access. The prices for community access range from 5 dollars for the yearly subscription to 20 dollars for a lifetime.Â  â P42 also reiterates that community access is NOT needed to share camera views, as they have built powerful importing and exporting methods that allow you to share camera views via any platform outside of their community ecosystem. â Refer to this blog post for further information on the optional community access system.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSDG recently released their Monastir Habib Bourguiba International Airport (DTMB) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Monastir, Tunisia, and has a yearly average of 1.6 million passengers. Its origins date back to World War 2, when it was known as Monastir Airfield and utilized by the United States Army Air Force during the North African Campaign. In the following decades, Monastir Airport experienced significant growth and expansion, driven by Tunisia's increasing popularity as a tourist destination. It's a hub for Nouvelair and is served seasonally by Air France, Air Serbia, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Discover Airlines, Eurowings, Smartwings, Sundair, TAP Air Portugal, Transavia, and Tunisair. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, custom ground clutter, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.02, requiring at least 872.30 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 has just released its latest Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 scenery. This time, the team has focused on the City of Derry Airport (EGAE) in Derry, Northern Ireland. The airport serves approximately 150,000 passengers each year. The airfield opened in 1941 as a Royal Air Force base and was used for military purposes until the 1950s. After that, the airport saw limited usage, with Emerald Airways operating a route to Glasgow. The airline constructed a new terminal building and control tower for the airport, with the first Glasgow flights commencing in 1967.Â  â A little over a decade later, Loganair began offering a few routes from the airport. Over the years, the airport has undergone various extensions and upgrades as it continued to grow and new airlines started to operate there.Â  â Today, airlines such as easyJet, Loganair, Ryanair, and Volotea serve the airport, providing destinations like Edinburgh, London, Manchester, and more. As a result, the airport handles approximately 7,000 aircraft movements and welcomes around 150,000 passengers annually. The scenery includes features like detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, night effects, highly detailed airport vehicles, vegetation, PBR materials, and static GA aircraft. The newly released City of Derry Airport is now available on SimMarket for approximately $15.69. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TDS Sim Software has recently released GTNXi for X-Plane 11 and 12. The GTNXi is a rendition of the Garmin 650Xi and 750Xi navigation with support for both Navigraph charts and data. Like its real-life counterpart, the GTNXi provides the pilot with various features, such as full autopilot control laterally and vertically (including support for LPV approaches), 8.33kHz COM frequency spacing, the ability to fly RF legs, a Glide Range Ring, a Smart Glide, and a Nearest Airport Indication Arrow. It also supports dual GPS/Flight plans, per-device CDI, mouse wheel zoom-in/out of the map page, full VC integration and a 2D pop-up available concurrently, worldwide live METAR, SmartGlide, and much more. The full list is rather lengthy, but it can be found in the .pdf manual included with the addon. The TDS GTNXi comes with VC integration support for X-Plane 12 for the following add-ons: If your favourite general aviation plane isnât on the list, don't worry! The GTNXi comes with Legacy VC Integration, which can detect and install the TDS add-on into all add-on aircraft that provide a legacy GTN 3D bezel unit. According to the developers, this will be useful for users with X-Plane 11 aircraft, as those will not come with TDS GTNXi VC Integration standards. More information about this can also be found in the .pdf manual. If the aircraft doesnât have VC-integrated GPS support, you can always use it as a 2D pop-up. The TDS Sim Softwareâs GTNXi can be purchased here for roughly $ 68.20. It requires X-Plane 11/12, Windows 10 (version 1909) or Windows 11, Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 3500, at least 16GB of RAM memory, Nvidia RTX2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT, with at least 4GB of video card memory, and at least 6GB of free space on hard disk. Navigraph subscription is also required for database updates and charts. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their new rendition of KrakÃ³w John Paul II International Airport v2 (EPKK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the city of KrakÃ³w, Poland, and has a yearly average of 11 million passengers, making it the second busiest airport in Poland. Its construction began in 1964, with its eventual opening for civil aviation three years later, in 1967.Â  During its first four years of operation, KrakÃ³w Airport didnât have a passenger terminal, which was only built in 1971. The 1970s also brought a runway extension, new taxiways, and the installation of high-intensity runway lights. In the late 1980s, the administration decided to build a new terminal, which opened in 1993. Shortly after, in 1995, an apron modernization followed. Further modernization was carried on in 2002 to ensure readiness for more international operations. A brand new terminal was constructed between 2013 and 2016 to ensure it could handle the extra traffic brought by Ryanairâs second Polish base, which opened in 2012. Two years ago, KrakÃ³w became Polandâs first regional airport to pass the 9 million passenger threshold. Such impressive traffic figures and eventual projected growth led to plans for a new terminal to better accommodate the extra influx.Â  The scenery features a high-quality rendition of the airport, with PBR materials, custom night lighting, a high-definition terrain mesh, performance-friendly interior modeling, an up-to-date ground layout, static aircraft, custom ground service equipment, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $19.88, requiring at least 1.52 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Parallel 42 Announces Changes to ChasePlaneâs Pricing System</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 recently made a blog post announcing their decision to stop charging an extra fee for cloud storageÂ and offerÂ the full experience in a singleÂ lifetimeÂ package. The community did not take too well to their original idea of charging extra for cloud storage due to how much it would cost Parallel 42 to keep the structure running. The options ranged from 5 dollars for a yearly subscription to 20 dollars for lifetime access.Â  â Even though community access was not required to share camera presets, as ChasePlane also features a powerful importer/exporter tool that allows people to simply share the files over on Discord or any file hoster, the backlash was immense due to how negatively the subscription system is generally viewed by simmers and gamers alike.Â  â With that in mind, Parallel 42 has decided to include the access with the base package without any extra charges. They will commit to the ever-growing expenses of running such cloud infrastructure while meeting their original price target.Â  â Such a decision was not made haphazardly; they conducted a very deep cost analysis to ensure it wouldnât eventually backfire.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
