    <summary>Sim: OTHER. FlyingArt has rolled out an update for their Cabby, AI Cabin Crew software, adding a dynamic Passenger Satisfaction Simulation, networked boarding screens, and 3D spatial audio.Â  Every flight now generates a unique manifest with individual profiles and fear-of-flying levels, so smooth landings and fewer delays keep your virtual cabin happy, while rough rides do not. The new Boarding Screen feature mirrors a real gate setup on a TV, tablet, or second monitor, with four layouts and simple network access.Â  3D spatial audio is also implemented, with announcements in realistic positions around the cabin, working with headphones, 5.1, or 7.1 setups, for a more convincing soundstage. Rounding things off are AI flight summaries, landing feedback, and a flight history map.Â  You can read more about Cabby and try it out on the FlyingArt website.Â Prices range from $12.00 to $22.00, with several plans available.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has recently released DCS World 2.9.21.16362, a substantial update that, among others, brings the long-requested F-14A-135-GR (Early).Â  This new variant captures the original fleet-defence interceptor era, powered by the quite notorious Pratt &amp; Whitney TF30-P-414A engines, and fitted with the AN/ALR-45/50 radar warning receiver, complete with its distinctive strobe display.Â  The RIO cockpit features new RWR panels and indicator lights, plus updated TACAN and volume panels. There is also a VF-101 Grim Reapers livery from 1978 included. Beyond the Tomcat, this update touches nearly every corner of DCS.Â The F-4E Phantom II, for example, has also seen an update from Heatblur, including an EFB, and the AN/APX-80A âCombat Treeâ IFF interrogator.Â  TV-guided weapon logic has been refined, new Zuni rockets have been added, and the Jester AI now has some new IFF options and a faster interface. Moving along, Eagle Dynamicsâ own aircraft have seen meaningful improvements, too. The MiG-29A has had its autopilot behaviour updated, the F-16C Viper and F/A-18C Hornet have gotten first-person visor effects and an expanded NCTR database, while the AH-64D Apacheâs George AI copilot has been updated with smarter flight logic, new control modes, and expanded commands. Furthermore, Ugra Mediaâs Normandy 2.0 has been updated with a new winter season, additional airfields across the Channel Islands, and dozens of fresh landmarks. Some new Swedish and Norwegian airfields have been added to Orbxâs Kola map, plus environmental refinements across the region. There are numerous other changes, summed up in the full changelog below: AI (Ground, Air, Sea) âDedicated Server Weapons User Interface Mission Editor Graphics / Effects 3D Models Features Launcher Currenthill Asset Pack Known Issue: Switching George AI Pilotâs altitude reference between radar and barometric when hovering at an altitude of 20 feet or less over the surface can cause a conversion error that will force George to land and may not be able to switch back to radar altitude. This has been fixed internally.

    <title>Miltech Simulations Shares October Progress Update </title>
    <updated>2025-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mtsoct"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68ffd0ad544caa222d4927f3_532517991_777431868129951_528965529907888171_n.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Miltech Simulations has recently published its October development blog, outlining progress across several of its big projects, including updates for the MH-60, Mission Hub, and Skyraider. New details on the U-2 Spyplane and CH-53 have also been shared. Miltech confirmed plans to gradually phase out MSFS 2020 development by 2026, citing the majority of users having already moved to MSFS 2024.Â  The MH-60, developed in partnership with Blackbird Simulations, remains one of Miltechâs flagship aircraft, and recently joined the Marketplaceâs Top-Rated Aircraft Sale.Â  A major v1.0.3 update is on the way, featuring an overhaul ofÂ  APU logic, improved flight model and SAS behaviour, and AFCS refinements.Â  The patch also introduces optional realistic INS alignment, new keybind support, and pop-out gauge functionality for multi-monitor setups.Â  In addition, the first Livery Pack is nearly complete, adding a nice selection of military and rescue variants from the US Navy, 160th SOAR, and other international operators. Meanwhile, the Miltech Mission Hub is preparing for its long-awaited Xbox release, with both MSFS 2020 and 2024 versions in final testing.Â The update introduces sling load enhancements, a distance measuring tool, new SAR scenarios, and expanded SimObjects including vehicles, ships, and rescue assets.Â  A Mission Builder App is also in development, allowing players to upload and share missions directly from the cloud. The upcoming Skyraider, also developed with Blackbird Simulations, has entered beta testing and is described as feature-complete for MSFS 2020, with a full conversion to the modular MSFS 2024 framework.Â  Miltech said that the project will include multiple variants, including the A-1H, AD-3W, AEW.1, and AD-4W, each tied to specific liveries. Pricing is expected to land in the mid-$20 USD range, covering all variants, and the aircraft will support both PC and Xbox platforms at launch. Also in active development is the U-2, a passion project that originally began in early 2023. Miltech is building both S (digital) and R (analogue) variants, with complex avionics systems, new ground equipment, and fully modelled chase cars.Â  The aircraft will come with five detailed airbases,Â  including Groom Lake (Area 51), Fairford, and Akrotiri, and will feature dynamic missions built for Mission Hub.Â  While no release window has been given, the developer notes that additional resources have been dedicated to bringing the project up to modern standards. Rounding out the lengthy blog, Miltech provided a brief look at the CH-53, showcasing its intricate rotor hub and configurable cabin layouts.Â  Both the CH-53E and MH-53E variants are in progress, leveraging MSFS 2024âs modular framework for high detail and performance efficiency.

    <title>Black Square Releases Beechcraft Baron &amp; Bonanza Bundle for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Black Square has recently released an aircraft bundle with the Beechcraft Baron and Bonanza for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Unlike their earlier steam gauge overhaul add-ons, this bundle features its own 3D models and custom sounds.Â  The bundle brings one of the most technically advanced simulations for Microsoft Flight Simulator (according to the developer), with an intricate reciprocating engine simulation, over a hundred possible failures, 12 hot-swappable radio configurations, and a custom turbocharger, pressurization, and cabin temperature simulation.Â  Furthermore, Black Squareâs new Electronic Flight Bag allows you to configure the aircraft, manage payload and failures, monitor engines, electric schematics, and more. On top of that, the custom failure system features persistent wear, MTBF, and scheduled failures for nearly every component in the aircraft, and the tridimensional gauges are subject to the laws of physics, meaning they can become stuck and require tapping on the glass to become unstuck again. In the navigation department, there are multiple navigation suites to choose from, ranging from various eras of both planesâ long history: from a humble no-GPS Bendix-King RNAV system to a modern Garmin GTN 650/750 (PMS or TDS), a slightly humbler GNS 530/430 combo, or the classic KLN 90-B. It also features the KFC 150 autopilot, the RDR1150XL weather radar, and more. The Beechcraft Baron set includes three distinct airframes: the normally aspirated B58, the B58TC, and the B58P. The latter is from the early 2000s, and the former two are from the 1980s. It also accompanies six different interiors and nine different liveries. On the other hand, the Bonanza set also includes three variations: the A36, the A36TC with an aftermarket turbo-normalising package, and the B36TP turboprop conversion. Similarly, it also sports six interiors and nine liveries. Overall, the package includes an entirely custom exterior model, a custom sound pack from Boris Audio Works, higher-quality materials, fine-tuned performance tables, more avionics options, and much more. The bundle is available on the Just Flight store for roughly $64.99, requiring at least 3.9 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has recently teased the development and imminent release of a B390 IA rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a light business jet designed and manufactured by Beechcraft. â The Beechcraft B-390 Premier IA was an updated version of the Premier 1, which was designed in the mid-90s, first flown in 1998, and certified in 2001. The IA was like a real-life patch to fix some lingering issues with the project, such as the subpar brakes, noisy cabin, and cockpit, which many deemed below par. Said upgrade rolled out in 2006, and over 163 new Premiers were built in five years. â The little jet is powered by two Williams FJ44-2A Turbofan engines. It cruises at 841 km/h, has a range of 950 miles, a service ceiling of 41,000 feet, and, depending on the configuration, can carry 6 to 7 passengers. â Thereâs no information regarding pricing or a release date, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. VA Systems has just launched a new web app named âThe Explorer.â This app is designed to search real-world airline schedules and, with one click, dispatch them directly with SimBrief. According to VA Systems, The Explorer provides users with quick access to their entire airline schedule database. Users can filter flights by departure and arrival airports, airline, aircraft type, time of day, and duration. These filters can be combined for more precise results. Once a flight is found, it can be sent directly to the user's SimBrief account for dispatching. Additionally, support for custom airframes from the user's SimBrief account is coming soon. The Explorer utilises a user-based pricing model, meaning a subscription is not necessary. Instead, users pay using a system of âCreditsâ by purchasing various credit packs. One credit is equivalent to one row of results returned. Users can set a limit on the number of results to control their spending. Accessing the Schedule view costs 20 credits. Saved searches, or âcachedâ searches, remain available for one hour, while schedules are stored for 24 hours. This allows users to view the same items multiple times within the time frame without incurring additional charges. â Credits can be purchased in packs, with the following pricing structure: â â VA Systems estimates that 1,000 credits will last for 1-2 months. â For more information about The Explorer, check out VA Systemâs website â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Brazil Land Games Previews Upcoming Porto Alegre Airport Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Brazil Land Games has recently previewed their work on updating their rendition of Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport (SBPA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024. It is the ninth busiest airport in the country, with nearly 8 million passengers yearly (pre-pandemic). Originally called SÃ£o JoÃ£o Federal Airport, it was just an air club, with its first flights dating back to 1923. It saw commercial action for the first time in 1932, when VARIG (the oldest Brazilian airline) replaced their seaplanes with land airplanes, adopting Porto Alegre as their hub. It took eight years to commission an actual passenger terminal. Its current name was adopted in 1952, after Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, a local politician who had died a year prior (air crash). Itâs a focus city for Azul Brazilian Airlines, with a significant domestic network (fifteen destinations) and international legs to Punta del Este and Montevideo (Uruguay). The other two Brazilian giants, GOL Linhas AÃ©reas (thirteen domestic destinations) and LATAM Brasil (5 domestic destinations), are also regularly seen around POA. TAP Air Portugal is the sole European visitor, coming from Lisbon. Not much was said besides the pictures themselves and the fact that itâs still undergoing development.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado recently shared further previews of their upcoming Beechcraft B-390 Premier 1A for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which is said to be âon final approachâ and â coming soon.â The new previews show more of the externals, one shot of the flight deck, and a shot of the cabin.Â  The Beechcraft B-390 Premier IA was an updated version of the Premier 1, which was designed in the mid-90s, first flown in 1998, and certified in 2001. The IA was almost like a real-life patch to fix some lingering issues with the project, such as the subpar brakes, the noisy cabin, and the cockpit, which was deemed below par by many. The aforementioned upgrade rolled out in 2006, and over 163 new Premiers were built in five years. The little jet is powered by two Williams FJ44-2A Turbofan engines. It cruises at 841 km/h, has a range of 950 miles, a service ceiling of 41,000 feet, and, depending on the configuration, can carry 6 to 7 passengers. â Thereâs no information regarding pricing or a release date, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <title>JATSim Designs Releases Rand Airport for MSFS 2020/MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. JATSim Designs has recently released its rendition of Rand Airport (FAGM) for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing one of South Africaâs most historic airfields to the simulator. Located in Germiston, near Johannesburg, Rand Airport first opened in 1931, and quickly became one of the most advanced facilities in the Southern Hemisphere. It served as the regionâs main international gateway, and operated as a hub for Imperial Airways, later South African Airways. During the Second World War, the airport played a crucial role in supporting military operations and training. With the opening of Jan Smuts Airport (now OR Tambo International) in 1952, Rand transitioned to a general aviation field. Today, it remains active as a centre for flight training, maintenance, and airshows, retaining much of its heritage and historical infrastructure. The scenery is available on simMarket for $14,50, including taxes. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!
