Elevator faults), brought visual improvements, and added new circuit breakers (bringing the total number of interactive C/B to 242!), as well as adding the ISCS (Interactive Simulation Control System) to the EFB. The full changelog is as follows: - ISCS in EFB - Hydraulic improvement package: 	. Added simulation of trapped hydraulic fluid in asymmetric actuators such as landing gear or spoiler actuators. 	. Fixed the PTU overheat when ENG1 is failed. - MCDU improvement package: 	. CLR command is now indented in scratchpad as in real life 	. DIR TO page prefills the RADIAL IN on the DIR TO page as required 	. FPLN Page Destination EFOB turns amber, if below minimum required. - ECAM improvement package: 	. Overspeed warning now triggers based on actual flap/slat position and not lever position (PFD barber pole is still lever position driven as in real life.) 	. Removed duplication of system titles if the same system shows multiple subsequent rows of ECAM messages. 	. Weight display logic for SD: Prior to engine start, the dashes are now cyan. Weights now only show after engine start, like in real life. 	. Status page improvement: Approach procedures for hydraulic faults 	. Rework of the ECAM messages for electrical bus failures to represent a newer FWC standard - FMGS improvement package: 	. Added possibility to use Airport ICAO codes as waypoints 	. Bug fixes for the path computation leading to an overall much stabler path computation in complex procedures. 	. Empty flight plan shows as PPOS / Discon rather than just "End of flpn" and can be built up from there. 	. VIA selection is now automatic, if there is exactly one VIA that matches the selected FINAL and STAR. 	. Constraints of first waypoint in STAR are not dropped anymore. 	- Added cross track error display on ground prior to departure - New failure modes: 	. Slow and rapid decompression 	. THS jam. 	. Cargo smoke, including latched closure of the isolation valves 	. Added high lift failures, including loss of SFCC channels and slats/flaps lock 	. Windshears with correct REAC W/S detection and indication. - Visual improvement package: 	. Added AoA Vanes to fuselage model 	. Fixed the tiller textures 	. Animated the flap lever guard 	. Correct the eye reference ball colors and location 	. Fixed text overlaps on the overhead panel - Added new Circuit breakers (for high lift, air conditioning packs, ...) bringing the total to 242 - Added pitch influence to the RADALT value, so that the RADALT decreases when you pitch up (like IRL) - Added limitation with filtering to the maximum number of waypoints shown on ND when WPT overlay selected. - Quick starts for engine and APU are now available on the Joystick/Actions tab. - Mapped flight number to x-plane dataref "sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/flight_id" for third party plugin interfacing. - Improved Master Warning flashing frequency. - Terrain on ND drawing around the airport is now inhibited for areas of same elevation as the airport. - If you select a livery with 2 OWE pairs, the maximum number of passengers will increase to 160. - Added selected heading value on ND, if in ARC mode the heading bug is not visible. â Bug fixes: - Fixed issue with the interaction between the CLR button and the status page - Fixed issue with status page overflow. - The emergency generator now consumes hydraulic fluid. - The magnetic variation model now updates for the current year. - Fixed FMA alignment of armed modes and issue with empty boxes - Extended the permissible value range for FCU speed window to 399kts and Mach 0.99 like in real life - Extended the permissible value range for FCU altitude window to 49000ft like in real life - ISI startup correction: QNH is also visible during ISI startup; moved QNH to right location. - Removed CHG CODE field for other phases than PREFLIGHT or DONE. - Improved string termination on MCDU string datarefs. - Fixed an issue with SID route in alternate plan on first alternate plan programming. - Fixed an issue with waypoints preceded by a discon where the outgoing leg is of the CI/CD/CR/CA or VI/VR/VD type. - Fixed FMA indication for managed descent on profile with significantly too slow speed. - Fixed behaviour of the FCU HDG managed dot when a managed mode (NAV, LOC, APPR) is armed. - Fixed shape of the ADF2 needle on the ND. - Removed GS indication on ND, when the associated ADIRU is OFF or invalid. - Made the deceleration when descending through the SPD LIM altitude smoother. - Fixed issue with the beta target leading to excessive rudder deflection and spoiler extension on the wrong side. - Corrected the color of the RAM Air Inlet indication when open in flight. - Disabled autobrake if 2 or more SECs are lost. - Fixed a bug that could cause sending many requests to the Hoppie network in a short period of time. - Miscellaneous other bug fixes Due to the migration of the updater repository, ToLiss recommends to perform a clean reinstall and download the aircraft from the store.Â  â The ToLiss A319 for X-Plane 11 and 12 is available for purchase on the X-Plane.org store, Aerosoft store and Simmarket for approximately $89.99. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations has issued a micro-update to their A320 Family (A319/A320/A321) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing more fixes to their 2024 port on systems, art, and tweaks to the EFB (both platforms). Update 2.3.0.553 is the fourth product line update since it was made compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It further enhances compatibility and improves overall stability by mitigating an issue where the aircraft would restart upon switching camera views or changing settings. A potential crash when handling inputs was also found and addressed. On the art side of things, they have fixed the registration and SELCAL not appearing at all, although they still appear black for the time being, and rain now travels in the correct direction. Their EFB has also undergone tweaking to fix potential errors when retrieving METARs with invalid data and to remove a slight pixel gap at the bottom of the app bar. The product line is available on their website for roughly $114 at the time of writing. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG has recently issued an update to their 777 lineup (777-300R and 777F) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The update cleans up a few items that required attention after the 777F release and addresses issues on the 777-300R caused by code changes to accommodate the 777F.Â  Update v2.00.0060 eliminates the ghost cargo door advisory and its associated TOCWS trigger on the 777-300ER and adds numerous model cleanups, logic fixes, and more. The changelog follows below: â They have also published new information on the status of their Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 port: they are now able to run code and debugging in MSFS 2024 after a recent update, but the memory allocation error from 2020 appears to be present in 2024 as well â despite PMDG reporting it in the past â, bringing the development effort to a halt as C++ WASM projects seem to rely heavily on advanced memory allocation techniques used by modern C++ compilers. That means they cannot run, build, or test code properly within MSFS 2024. The 737 family will soon receive an update to address the issue with the Universal Flight Tablet not loading properly. Thereâs no exact prediction of when it will be available for Marketplace users, but it should be coming soon for PMDG.com customers. PMDGâs aircraft lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TorqueSim has released their long-awaited CItationJet 525 for X-Plane 12. After more than six years of development, one of the most popular business jets is finally here! Produced to replace the ageing Citation I and IIs, the Cessna CitationJet 525 had its first flight in April 1991 and has since been developed into Model 525A, 525B, and 525C. Over 2000 CitationJets have been produced, making them the most produced business jets. Capable of cruising up to altitudes of 41,000ft and equipped with two Williams R-R FJ44-1A turbofan engines, this T-tail jet can fly at Mach 0.65 for around 1560 nautical miles ( ~2880km). The TorqueSimâs rendition of CitationJet 525 features an authentic flight model with custom airfoils, custom soundpack, high-resolution textures, custom-developed electrical, hydraulic, fuel, and pneumatic systems, custom Honeywell avionics. It also supports RealityXP GNS/GTN, as well as the upcoming TDS Sim GTNXi. The TakeCommand! CitationJet 525 is available for purchase at the X-Aviation store for $84.95.Â  It is compatible with X-Plane 12 only and can be used on MacOS 12+ (at least Monterey), Windows 10+, and Linux (support is provided only for Ubuntu 24.02 LTS). The recommended specifications for it are CPU with 4+ Cores (3 GHz+), 16+ GB RAM, and NVIDIA or AMD GPU with 4+ GB VRAM. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <title>TDS Sim Software Updates GTNXi Pro for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2024-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TDS Sim Software has recently released an update to their GTNXi Pro Suite, adding compatibility with Microsoftâs latest flight simulator. While their original plan was to make it compatible as soon as MSFS 2024 was out, a WASM gauge issue made it impossible for a few weeks. However, Asobo has finally managed to address the show stopperâto an extentâas another update blocked the display. A community developer found a workaround that will suffice until an official fix is out. The development team is excited about the new platform and all its possibilities, gauging what they can benefit from and the work it would entail. They have coded the new executable to detect the exact MSFS platform (whether 2020 or 2024) and correctly share it between platforms. Each MSFS version has its own different WASM gauge. â Owners of the base GTNXi package will have to upgrade in order to get compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Refer to this link for further information on acquiring the upgrade. â The GTNXi Pro is available on their website for $68.20, whereas the pro upgrade from the standard package retails for $26.20.
