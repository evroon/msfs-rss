    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSDG has recently released their rendition of Amílcar Cabral International Airport (GVAC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Espargos, Sal, in Cape Verde, with an average of 1.2 million passengers per year. It was built in 1939 by the Italians as a pit stop for flights from Europe to South America, though their involvement ended quickly due to World War 2. It wasn’t until the end of the conflict that Portugal purchased it from Italy and began its completion, becoming fully operational by 1949. For a bit more than a decade, between 1963 and 1975, the Portuguese Air Force operated at the airport, providing support to military air connections between Portugal and its African provinces and serving as an operational base for patrol aircraft occasionally deployed there. To this day, it’s still an important stopover for international flights and one of the most common ETOPS destinations, in case any flight encounters a failure mid-crossing the ocean. It’s a hub for Cabo Verde Airlines, and served by AlbaStar, Air Senegal, Binter Canarias, Bulgaria Air, Corendon, easyJet, Edelweiss, Enter Air, Luxair, Neos, Royal Air Maroc, Smartwings, Sunclass, TAP Air Portugal, Transavia, TUI Airways, TUI fly Belgium, TUI fly Deutschland, TUI fly Netherlands, TUI fly Nordic, and Vueling. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, detailed 3D models, a custom interior for the passenger terminal, realistic night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and more. ​ It’s available on SimMarket for roughly $20, requiring at least 60.59 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Linovt has recently released their rendition of Vilar de Luz Airport (LPVL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a regional airfield serving Porto, in Portugal. Construction of the airfield began in 1992, and it wasn’t opened to traffic until late 1995.  It currently houses a Cessna Maintenance Center, an ATPL flight school (Nortávia), and Skydive Maia, a popular skydiving school and centre. Furthermore, it also houses Porto’s Aero Club, founded in 1935. It’s a VFR and MVFR daytime-only airport due to the lack of runway lighting and approach systems, and is mostly used for general aviation (flight training, circuits, etc.).  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, a realistic runway elevation profile, detailed landside, a fully modeled Skydive Hangar interior, a fully modeled Café interior, custom airport vehicles, and more. It’s available on SimMarket for roughly $17.88, requiring at least 104.79 MB of free hard drive space to install.

    <title>Gaya Simulations Announces Corfu International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Gaya Simulations has recently announced their return to consumer-facing development with a Corfu International Airport (LGKR) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Corfu, Greece, with an average of 4.3 million passengers per year. ​ It was founded in 1937 and was taken over by the Axis forces shortly after, serving as a base for transport and fighter aircraft. During most of its early life, the runway was only 600 meters long. ​ It wasn’t until 1949 that Corfu would get its first runway expansion, adding 200 meters in total length, and then nearly doubling a few years later to accommodate larger aircraft. ​ The first passenger terminal was built in 1962, and its International debut happened three years later.  ​ With its newly granted international status and an ever-rising yearly passenger count, a new terminal was built between 1968 and 1972. ​ As of 10 years ago, Corfu International was privatized and acquired by a joint venture between Fraport and the Copelouzos Group. The deal will be valid for 40 years as of 2017. ​ It’s a focus city for Aegean Airlines and Ryanair. Air France, Air Serbia, Arkia, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, easyJet, Edelweiss Air, Eurowings, ITA Airways, Jet2.com, Luxair, Neos, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Sky Express, Smartwings, Swiss, Transavia, TUI, Volotea, and Wizz Air also serve it. ​ The developers promise an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality 3d models, and up-to-date ground layout, custom night lighting, custom ground service equipment, and more. ​ There’s no information regarding pricing or the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed.

Furthermore, the developers have refined the Flight Management System with improved fuel planning, vertical navigation, and route editing. The holding pattern logic has also been improved. Vertical and lateral navigation were tweaked to ensure better waypoint handling, corrected constraint formatting, refined DIR TO logic, enhanced airway and manual waypoint validation, and more. Numerous cosmetic corrections were also carried out around the MCDU pages to ensure maximum acuity.  The navigation tweaks brought on by this update will lay the groundwork for the implementation of FLS (Flight Management Landing System), which is already in active development. ‍ The passenger cabin has been entirely reworked, with high-resolution textures, per-variant accuracy, animated window blinds, customized lighting environments, and a fully functional cabin signage system.  The core systems have also been massively improved, with engine and FADEC logic refinements across the board, spanning the start sequencing, thrust management, bleed configuration tables, and revised acceleration and breakaway behavior. ​ The add-on is available in their store for roughly $69.95 + VAT.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PhotoRico has recently released their rendition of Muñoz Marín International Airport (TJSJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving San Juan, Puerto Rico, with an average of 13.4 million passengers per year. Planning for the airport’s construction began in 1945, when the government recognized they’d need a newer, larger airport to keep up with the air traffic demands of the following decades, since the region's main airport had a very short runway and could not be expanded further.  The project received approval in 1946; work began in 1947, and by 1949, they had completed the first phase, which involved cleaning, filling, leveling, and draining the soil. By the latter half of that year, they were already paving the runways and taxiways. The inauguration only took place in 1955, six years later, with a six-story passenger terminal, a control tower, a 2,400-meter-long runway, and basic aeroportuary infrastructure. ​ The 1960s brought further expansion, including lengthening the runway for jets and the addition of a second runway (which was only completed in the 1970s).  ​ In the late 1980s, a $137 million investment was announced to expand the passenger terminal and make multiple improvements to the airport, which were carried out between the 90s and early 2000s.  ​ It was followed by another terminal expansion in the early 2000s, making Terminal B slightly larger and remodeling the hotel, among other minor things. In the 2010s, despite the significant drawbacks of the 2008 crisis (leading, for example, to American Airlines greatly reducing its presence), the airport underwent further work, including a new passenger terminal, new pavement, new lighting systems, press conference rooms, and more. ​ It’s a hub for M&amp;N Aviation and Tradewind Aviation, and a focus city for JetBlue. Air Canada Rouge, Air Transat, American Airlines, Arajet, Avelo Airlines, Avianca, Cape Air, Contour Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Iberia, Southwest Airlines, Spirit, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and WestJet also serve it. ​ The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with fully detailed terminals, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom taxi lights, performance-friendly optimization, and custom weathering. ​ It’s available on OrbxDirect (2020/2024) for roughly $22.38, requiring at least 1.60 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Nordheimer Creek Ranch (CA107) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a tricky airstrip tucked into a steep, narrow mountain valley in California.  Located in the Six Rivers National Forest (Orleans, California), the Nordheimer Ranch Airfield is one of the most challenging airstrips in the United States, with a punishingly short runway and difficult terrain, with no margin for error. The area is known for its high-altitude lakes, dense forests, and diverse wildlife, attracting tourists from all over. Furthermore, its rich past continues to attract attention to this day, be it the remnants of old mining operations and the ancient fruit trees left by homesteaders centuries ago. It’s also famously known for world-class kayaking and rafting, with the nearby Nordheimer Campground being a very popular base for rafters. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airstrip, with high-fidelity visuals, PBR texturing, advanced collision modeling for out-of-cockpit exploration, and much more. ​It’s available on OrbxDirect for roughly $8.53, requiring at least 485.70 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In their most recent post on their forums, iniBuilds has shared their latest development update for their upcoming rendition of the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This development update focuses on core systems and flight model, as well as exterior and interior visuals. The team reports that extensive work has been done on the flight model, with a strong focus on the three Rolls Royce RB211-524 engines powering the Tristar. Within their engine model, they have built in authentic EPR logic, tuned engine spool, and inertia characteristics in order to faithfully represent the engine’s performance across all power levels and phases of flight. A distinct feature of the L-1011 - Direct Lift Control (DLC) - is fully simulated, assisting pilots in vertical adjustments along the glidepath without major changes in pitch. Core systems and automation in the L-1011, such as the Automatic Flight Control System are simulated, giving full CAT IIIB autoland capability with accurate flare logic, de-rotation behaviour, and rollout control. This extends to the navigation systems, auto-throttle, and lateral and vertical modes, accurately modeling the automations making the L-1011 so advanced for its time. Detailed electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, fuel, and environmental control systems will also be included. The iniBuilds team plan on making a fully interactive Flight Engineer station, but will also have an automatic operation option. When it comes to navigation systems, iniBuilds say that they wanted to provide flexibility to “support everyone: from casual flyers [...] to the most dedicated purists”. To achieve that goal, they are giving users the multiple options, from a simple RADNAV-based system all the way up to a modern GPS-based one. This will all be selectable through their new “Paper Flight Bag”, a vintage alternative to the electronic flight bags. iniBuilds will also support importing flight plans from SimBrief or the simulator EFB directly into the INS. On the visual side, iniBuild’s rendition of the Tristar will feature detailed cockpit textures, accurate interior lighting for each panel, and realistic wear and tear on the materials. Much focus has been put on the mechanical accuracy, with realistic spoiler lift and flap movement. On release, iniBuilds will include a variety of “3D Decal” liveries of operators of the L-1011-500, such as Delta, British Airways, LTU, Air Transat, Pan Am, and United. iniBuilds has not announced a release date yet, but they say that development is now “entering the final stages”, and they will be releasing another development update prior to release. ‍ Stay tuned to Threshold for the latest in flight simulation! ‍ If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has recently announced the development and imminent release of Key West International Airport (KEYW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving Key West, Florida, with an average of 1.5 million passengers per year. The airport’s history goes back over a century, when Augustin Parla flew to Cuba in 1913. Fifteen years later, Pan American Airways began flying scheduled routes from Key West. It was briefly taken over by the US Army during World War 2 after the Pearl Harbor attack, as an alternative to the Trumbo Point seaplane base and the main Naval Air Station for fixed-wing aircraft. ​ It was returned to the city after the war, leading to its application for FAA grants in 1953 and its designation as Key West International Airport. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, JetBlue, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery will feature custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground service equipment, custom terminal interiors, custom jetways, and more. ​ There’s no information on the release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed.

    <title>A2A Simulations Announces Accu-Sim Legacy RG550 for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2026-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/a2alegacy"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of their third airplane for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: the Legacy RG550, a high-performance experimental kit-built aircraft! It’s the first time A2A Simulations has developed a kit-built airplane, which poses a significant challenge because no two kit-built aircraft are identical. But they claim it’s “perfect” for their Accu-Sim lineup because that individuality is the essence of their digital ownership philosophy. ​ The reference unit at hand is based on a real airplane owned and flown by Scott Gentile (A2A’s founder) for a number of years, allowing them to intricately replicate its flight dynamics, behavior, and quirks, just like the Comanche 250 and the Aerostar 600 (which they also happen to own, although the Aerostar 600 is no longer under their ownership).  ​ The add-on will feature fully custom flight physics, a custom sound design, persistent wear and tear, multiple avionics configurations (including a full custom Garmin G5 simulation that will be retrofitted into the Comanche and Aerostar), laser-scanned and photogrammetry assisted 3D modeling, in-depth electrical simulation, fully simulated systems, and a highly detailed engine simulation model, down to individual sparks during combustion. ​ It’s scheduled for release in Q2 2026, and pricing is yet to be announced (though it will likely fall in the usual $49.99 ballpark).
