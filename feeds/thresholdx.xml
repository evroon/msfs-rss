    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A member of the PMDG forum has discovered an internal link on PMDG's website leading to a user manual for their upcoming Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This manual reveals many features that had not been previously mentioned and provides answers to questions from the community that were left unanswered or only vaguely addressed by the company's CEO, Robert Randazzo. The new website not only includes the manual but also showcases a variety of liveries available for the plane. Furthermore, it unveils several previously undisclosed features, providing users with a comprehensive look at what the plane has to offer. Furthermore, the manual also provides insight into some of the included features. Here is a list of some of the most interesting features: After a user shared the new website, most of the responses and the original message were deleted from the forum. Following this, Mathijs at PMDG published the following: "Kudos to the person who used a domain scanner to find the manual, but this is indeed unplanned, so let's not make it a topic here." In the end, it looks like the manual was not supposed to be released, but when it was, we did get quite a good look at the new plane. If you want to check out the manual, it was available while we were writing this article, but is no longer there and rather humorously they redirected the URL to a Rick Roll. We will keep you informed as more information becomes available about the upcoming PMDG 777. Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for the most recent flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlyTampa has recently released its version of Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (YSSY) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the Australian city of Sydney and is situated approximately 5 miles (8 kilometres) from the city. As the biggest and busiest airport in Australia, it welcomes around 42 million passengers annually. In 1919, Nigel Love leased and established an airfield on grassy paddocks in the suburb of Mascot. The first flight from the airfield was with Love in 1919, and the official opening took place in 1920. After the lease ended in 1923, the Commonwealth Government acquired the airfield, just before the first regular flights began in 1924. The first gravel runway was built in 1933, and by 1949, the number of runways had tripled. Construction for a new terminal started in 1966 and was officially opened in 1970. Over the years, the airport has undergone several upgrades and constructions. Today, the airport serves numerous cities worldwide and is a hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia, as well as many other airlines, with a yearly total of over 300,000 aircraft movements. The newly released version of Sydney Airport includes many features such as a fully custom rendition of Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, custom mesh, custom night lighting, SAM and LST integration, Ortho4XP patch, and much more. The newly released add-on is now available on Orbx for approximately $32.50. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. CAT3DUAL has released their rendition of Sfax-Thyna Airport (DTTX) for MSFS. The airport serves the city of Sfax in Tunisia and has a yearly average of 200.000 passengers. It is located 6 kilometres outside the city of Sfax. During WWII, the airport was used by the USAF during the North African campaign and was known as Sfax Airfield. Two bombardment groups used this airfield - the 12th and 340th Bombardment Group, both using the B-25 Mitchell. After the war, Sfax Airport received many extensions and improvements, with the most important one being the construction of the new terminal in 1988 and the extension of the runway. In the following years, a cargo terminal was added, along with a warehouse, taxiways and the airport apron reconstruction. The latest expansion was finished in 2007, when a new terminal, consisting of three buildings, and a new control tower were built. Today, Sfax-Thyna Airport serves 6 airlines to 7 destinations, and many charter flights from Germany and UK during the summer season. CAT3DUALâs rendition of DTTX features custom buildings on the airfield, main apron including an eastern expansion, accurate airfield way finders: taxiway signs and markings, airfield lighting placement and colours per Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), custom perimeter wall and more. This scenery can be purchased on SimMarket for approximately 8.68$ and requires at least 135MB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlyTampa has released their rendition of Humberside Airport (EGNJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving Lincolnshire, Kingston upon Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire, this airport welcomes around 90.000 passengers per year. Opened in 1941 as an RAF air base, RAF Kirmington housed the 166th RAF Squadron that operated Avro Lancasters. After 1945, the airport was abandoned for 30 years, until the local council decided to activate the airfield again. After the local area was renamed, the airport was renamed to Humberside Airport. Due to the proximity of other airports, Humberside faces competition from East Midlands and Leeds Bradford Airport. This is because competitive airports have a wider range of passenger flights. The airport serves only two airlines with scheduled passenger flights, KLM to Amsterdam and Eastern Airways to Aberdeen, while during the summer season, TUI has charter flights to Palma de Mallorca, and BH Air to Burgas. FlyTampaâs version of Humberside Airport features Hi-res modelling and PBR textures, a modelled terminal interior with animated passengers, a GSX profile, and LOD performance modelling. This scenery can be purchased on FlyTampaâs website for 12.99$. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

    <title>Jetstream Designs Announces Geneva Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jetgen"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/664ce3761ae36b5b1651cb09_lsgg1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Jetstream Designs has recently announced the development of Geneva Airport (LSGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This international Airport serves Grand GenÃ¨ve (Genevaâs metropolitan area) and has a yearly average of 14 million passengers. â It was first established as an airfield in Cointrin, near Geneva (which explains the airport still being informally known as Cointrin Airport), in October 1919. It wasnât until the late 1920s that the airport would get appropriately structured, with concrete hangars instead of makeshift wooden sheds.Â  â The first concrete runway was built in 1937, with a total length of 405 meters.Â  â The airport was heavily expanded during World War 2, as the Swiss authorities banned any departures for safety reasons. The runway was extended to 1200 meters near the end of the war, and provisions were made to ensure further expansion capabilities in the future. The first passenger terminal was built in 1946, costing 2.3 Swiss Francs to the authorities, along with a runway expansion to 2000 meters.Â  The runway was expanded for the last time in 1960, with jet traffic in mind, taking it from 2000 meters to 3900 meters. This is an unusually long runway for an airport of that size, and a territorial exchange had to be made between Switzerland and France to ensure that there would be enough room for it.Â  â In the late 1980s, a new passenger terminal was built, with 12 jet bridges and two ground-floor gates. It ultimately replaced the old one from 1946, which now only opens during winter charter season.Â  â Itâs a hub for Swiss International Air Lines and an operating base for EasyJet Switzerland. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, ITA, Jet2.com, KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Transavia, TUI Airways, United Airlines, Vueling, and Wizz Air also serve it. While a feature list has not been provided, the many screenshots shared on their social media platforms reveal some of it: custom ground textures, custom jetways, terminal interiors, and custom runway textures. Jetstream also proudly announces that Marcus Nyberg, a scenery developer from Orbx, has joined them to help with Geneva and future projects. Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. BMWorld and AmSim recently released their rendition of San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the San Francisco Bay Area and has a yearly average of 50.1 million passengers. â Initially meant to be a temporary and experimental airport project when the city of San Francisco leased 61 hectares of land in 1927 from the Mills Estate (owned by Ogden L. Mills), it quickly became a permanent commitment with the purchase of the land and its surroundings, totaling up to 450 hectares of area.Â  It was briefly used as a Coast Guard base and an Army Air Corps training and staging base during World War 2. Following the war, international air travel boomed, prompting the airport's final name change to San Francisco International Airport in 1945. The jet age ushered in a new chapter for SFO. In the 1950s, longer runways were constructed to accommodate larger jetliners and new terminals were built to handle the increased passenger volume and the demands of international travel. â SFO's commitment to innovation continued throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The airport embraced new technologies, such as jet bridges and baggage carousel systems, to improve passenger experience. In 1971, SFO became the first airport in the United States to have an automated people mover system, the AirTrain. â It's a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate airport rendition, with high-resolution ground textures, custom ground markings, animated jetways, aÂ detailed terminal area, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $22.50, requiring at least 1.84GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. AviaSim Designs recently released their rendition of Conington Aerodrome / Peterborough Business Airport (EGSF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This privately owned airfield is 13 kilometers south of Peterborough in the English county of Cambridgeshire. Originally built as RAF Glatton in 1942-1943 by the 809th United States Army Corps of Engineers to house B-17 bombers of the 457th Bomb Group, it was passed to the Royal Air Force after the end of the war. A year later, it was mothballed, and most of the structure vanished over the following years, leaving just a hangar and a water tower. The airfield saw some use in the 1960s from two local companies, which used its runway and hangar to store their aircraft. A ground engineer provided basic maintenance facilities.Â  Aerolease Ltd. currently operates it, and aviation fuel is available on-site. Hangarage and parking must be arranged beforehand. The current layout consists of two runways: runway 16/34, which isnât AIP or NAPS listed, is approximately 800 meters long and in worse condition than the listed one (10/28), which is slightly longer at 987 meters. The scenery features an up-to-date layout, custom aerial imagery, 4K PBR textures, custom ground poly, sloped runway profile, dynamic lighting, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.86, requiring at least 335.30 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. ShortFinal Design recently released its rendition of San Jose International Airport (KSJC) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves Santa Clara Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and has a yearly average of 12 million passengers. â Officially opened in 1939, its first proper runway was only built six years later on land leased by test pilot James M. Nissen and his partners. A hangar and an office building for a flight school were also built.Â  The city took over shortly after, with James Nissen becoming the airport's first manager, considerably instrumental in its infrastructural development. â The increased demand for air travel in the 1960s led to constructing the first proper terminal building, which later became Terminal C. Throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, SJC witnessed continued growth. Terminal A opened in 1990, followed by the city council's approval of a new master plan for long-term expansion in 1997.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Microsoft has recently released the long-awaited Sim Update 5 for Microsoft Flight Simulator after a series of delays and controversies. The new update brings performance improvements, faster loading times, airport fixes, and the A320neo V2 by iniBuilds. â Focusing on performance gains and stability, Sim Update 15 claims to bring significant framerate gains where it was otherwise low, fewer stutters, especially on long sessions, and substantially faster loading times. The performance figures on glass cockpit heavy airplanes, such as the 747, have also been greatly improved thanks to their work optimizing the Coherent/JS tech stack. On the stability front, Microsoft has devised a way to stop the console version from crashing when it runs out of memory by detecting the issue before it happens and temporarily reallocating the memory, causing a brief loss of detail quality while preventing a hard crash. â The physics front has also seen changes, with a new high-accuracy physics system to enable vibrations and micro-movements, a more accurate ground contact model, and an optional soft ground collision model for tires and flexible gears.Â  â The A320neo V2 by iniBuilds is now available, featuring a high-quality 3D model, improved system fidelity, high-resolution textures, and a high-detail cabin for PC users. Microsoft has shared a video introducing us to the brand-new aircraft: â The complete changelog follows below: â The update is available right now on all compatible platforms.
