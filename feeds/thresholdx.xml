    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations recently issued another update to their newly released Accu-Sim Aerostar 600 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing a âhealthy mixâ of fixes, tweaks, visual improvements, and a set of new liveries. Update v0.9.9 brings under-the-hood changes to how the aircraft is built within Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, warranting a smoother experience overall. However, a small number of users might need to remap their controls after updating. Furthermore, the update adds a USB port to the EDM790, fixes a glitch with the yoke trim, restores the tail rope position on the ground, and more. The complete changelog follows below: â - Added three new liveries - Beacon animation is no longer affected by the time slider - EDM790 has mini usb port - Fix for dirt not acumulating sometimes - Fixed font paths in registration css - Fixed radio knobs occasionally working in opposite direction - Fixed the bad lighting on the left oil dipstick - Fixed the gap on the top left window and the frame - Fixed typo in N122PC ATC ID - Fixed yoke trim switch glitching sometimes - New initial avatar position - Restored the tail rope position on the ground - Sounds for yoke buttons and temperature gauge switch - Toe brakes are no longer depressed when loading on a parking spot The three new liveries are still work-in-progress, and one of them comes from a popular Hollywood movie involving smuggling illegal substances across the border. The add-on is available on their website for $49.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>SHADESCENE Releases Tawau Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/689ea05e070d54ee4b675e6e_tawau1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. SHADESCENE has recently released their rendition of Tawau Airport (WBKW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the Tawau Division in Malaysia and has a yearly average of 572,365 passengers. The airport was inaugurated in December 2001, replacing Tawauâs former main airport. It was small and tricky due to its very short runway (one of the shortest in Malaysia), which caused great concern overall.Â  The official inauguration only happened two years later, in 2003.Â  Its passenger terminal has one and a half stories, with two jetways and the ability to accommodate up to 8 airplanes simultaneously. â Before COVID-19, the airport was operating above maximum capacity, reaching 1.8 million passengers yearly, significantly exceeding its intended 1.4 million passenger capacity. A plan was made to expand it to 2.5 million passengers and upgrade the passenger facilities and overall infrastructure. COVID put a halt to the expansion plans, and in 2022, they were still facing the same issue, constantly suffering from congestion. â In 2023, the government allocated a substantial sum for an improvement program, including extra toilets, an enhanced check-in area, an expanded departure lounge, more retail spaces, and more air conditioning units. A year later, a new plan was announced, encompassing a major expansion set to begin in 2025. The expansion will bring the main terminal from 15,800 square meters to 23,500, add eight new check-in counters, and more. The new capacity would remain aligned with the previous project at 2.5 million passengers annually. â AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, and MASwings serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.02, requiring at least 345.46 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Aerosoft Updates Mega Airport Frankfurt to Version 1.1</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has just released an update for Mega Airport Frankfurt for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. While the changelog is brief, this update introduces optimisations that significantly decrease VRAM usage and enhance overall performance. The latest update introduces optimisations for all models, textures, LOD settings, and more. This has allowed for a reduction in VRAM usage of up to 1.6 GB, though most users can expect a slightly smaller decrease. Some users reported performance drops when facing Terminal 2. This issue was caused by the large forest north of the terminal, but it has now been resolved. The team has noted a bug with blurry textures in the scenery, and they are currently working on a patch that is expected to be released by early next week. The updated version of Mega Airport Frankfurt is now available at Aerosoft on sale for $18.41. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>iFly Outlines Future Plans, Confirms MSFS 2024 Focus and MAX 9</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has via Discord released an official development update for its 737 MAX product, outlining planned features for the Service Pack 1 update, as well as its plans for the MSFS 2024 platform. The team made it clear that the SP1 content is still in active development, and that the update will not be released within the next three months. Amongst the changes in SP1 are a more âtablet-styleâ electronic flight bag (EFB), rather than the current Boeing OEM unit, accompanied by CPDLC integration via the Hoppie API, with support for online networks, as well as BATC and SayIntentions, also under review. Other planned features include cabin announcements (with and without GSX), the MAX 8-200 variant, with the typeâs Mid-Cabin Emergency Doors modelled, a visual APU model, an expanded main wheel well model, and an updated fuselage model, rivets and other details.  Cabin materials will be redrawn with more texture detail, multiple seating layouts will be offered, and cockpit materials will be refined for better surface type distinction. Landing gear textures will be overhauled, LNAV behaviour will see targeted adjustments, and numerous smaller fixes will be implemented before release. The update also marks a shift in development priorities. SP1 will be the final major release to support MSFS 2020, with all future development moving to MSFS 2024, due to substantial platform differences between the two. Post-SP1 plans include a native MSFS 2024 version of the MAX 9, with the MAX 10 and MAX 7 also under consideration, only after official certification and service entry of those types. While small patches may still arrive for the current MAX 8 for 2020 after SP1, iFlyâs primary focus will be advancing the series for the newer simulator. You can read the full development update on iFly's official Discord server.  For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has shared an update of its highly anticipated HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update was posted on its community forum earlier this week. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, this is the third and final planned preview before release. The previews highlight the Delta TechOps area and the airportâs control tower, amongst others. Delta TechOps, also known as Delta TOC, is the largest airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in North America, and has been recreated in the scenery, with 1:1 accuracy. Veneziani stated that âevery pipe, air-conditioning unit, and rooftop elementâ was individually modelled, based on real-world references. While the developer showcased the maintenance complex, he noted that the airside portion of the airport is not yet ready for display, as the ground polygon is still in progress. Remaining work includes cargo buildings on both the north and south sides, taxiway signage, approach lighting, and tunnel detailing, as well as general finishing touches. According to Veneziani, the goal is to release the scenery before Christmas. He noted that development has been underway for nearly two years, with a continued emphasis on quality over timelines. HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport is the worldâs busiest by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, serving as Delta Air Linesâ primary hub. We'll keep you updated on its release. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Burning Blue Design has released a detailed rendition of Welshpool Airport (EGCW) for MSFS 2020 and 2024, recreating the small but significant general aviation hub in Central Wales.Â  Situated 2.3 miles south of the market town of Welshpool in Powys, the airfield, also known as Mid Wales Airport, was established in the early 1990s, and has since developed into a licensed civil aerodrome. Today, it serves as a base for the Wales Air Ambulance, and hosts a wide variety of activities, including pleasure flights, helicopter operations, and flight training. Burning Blue Designâs scenery was built upon extensive on-site research, and features more than 100 custom 3D objects and full PBR texturing. This includes accurate runways and taxiways, hand-crafted hangar interiors with animated doors, custom windsocks, dynamic animated flags, spectators, and realistic night lighting. The developers have also implemented colour-corrected high-resolution ground textures and ensured compatibility with both MSFS 2020 and 2024. Welshpool Airport scenery is available now via the Burning Blue website for Â£8.95, with releases on Orbx and the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace set to follow.

    <title>Microsoft Releases Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the highly anticipated Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024, marking one of the biggest updates to the simulator since launch. It brings performance fixes, weather and world upgrades, aircraft, traffic, and ATC changes, airport improvements, SDK updates, and broad adjustments to core systems, and career mode. Labelled version 1.5.27.0, SU3 brings wide-ranging changes, including the highly requested ability to locally download content from the MSFS Library. This allows more control over content management, with simulator files being able to be stored locally on a userâs system, rather than relying solely on cloud-based streaming and internet downloads. Fixes to weather include an issue where the correct METAR data was not always honoured at airports; furthermore, lightning in storms is now far less excessive, thunderstorm prediction is better, and cloud transitions on the world map are smoother. Distant cloud lighting has been improved, photogrammetry tile popping is reduced, and map camera zooming has been corrected. Streaming reliability should be better, including fixes for freezes caused by mislabelled sound folders. AI and live traffic now flow more smoothly, with fewer overshoots, ârear-end incidentsâ, and stuck vehicles. Taxi speeds have been tuned, parked aircraft distribution rebalanced, and model-matching now prefers AI-optimised assets. Contrails rendering has been improved, gear animations have been corrected, livery depiction improved, and generic placeholder aircraft have been phased out. Aircraft across the default fleet have received updates, with refinements to Garmin avionics and autopilot systems. The Boeing 787, 747, and Airbus A320neo have seen flight dynamics and stability tweaks, while the Cessna 172 and Daher TBM 930 have received various bug fixes and performance improvements. Significant performance and stability upgrades have also been introduced. Sim Update 3 includes better memory management, improved CPU and GPU balancing, and reduced stuttering, during heavy scenery loading. Smoother framerates should be noticable in high-density areas, such as large international airports, and photogrammetry-heavy cities.Â  Some of the addressed issues include Xbox boot crashes when many packages are installed, several rare parser and stallâwarning crashes, VR in/out switching, airportârendering freezes, and texture handling that could corrupt WASM gauges, on Series S, or lowâtexture settings on PC. Menu caching in Controls now reduces unnecessary file I/O, and avatar thumbnails are generated faster. DLSS MultiâFrame Generation options have been corrected, and multiple content management edge cases have been cleaned up, in order to prevent profile or content conflicts. Sim Update 3 is available now on all platforms, as a free download for all MSFS 2024 users. Full patch notes can be found on the official Microsoft Flight Simulator website, and the MSFS forums. Be aware, Microsoft is currently investigating an issue with SU3 deployment, on Xbox and Microsoft Store. This may cause issues with downloading the update, for certain machines.
