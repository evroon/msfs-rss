    <title>Drzewiecki Design Releases Warsaw-Radom Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2026-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ddradom24"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/696aeeb4d221e2f6ed06f3ac_radom1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their freeware rendition of Warsaw-Radom Airport (EPRA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Radom, Poland, with an average of 112,610 passengers per year. It was built in early 1929 as a training facility for Poland’s first civilian pilot training school, and was eventually handed over to the military in 1932, which greatly expanded the facility by buying additional land and building hangars, barracks, and a shooting range. It then became a training facility for military pilots and paratroopers. As soon as World War 2 started, the base was heavily damaged by bombings, completely destroying the aircraft based there, some of the hangars, and forcing the crew to evacuate. The Germans took over the airport and used it to train and prepare their pilots for combat on the Eastern Front.  By the end of the conflict, the airport was once again heavily damaged and mined, requiring extra effort from the Polish Army to get it back into shape, which they have done rather promptly. They have been conducting pilot training sessions continuously since mid-1945. In mid-2006, Radom’s municipal administration established Port Lotniczy Radom S.A., with a hefty budget, to operate as a civilian airport. It wasn’t until the early 2010s that the necessary work was carried out to prepare the airport for such a task, though. In 2012, they bought Lodz’ airport's former terminal (disassembled) and reassembled it the following year, completing it a year later.  AirBaltic and Czech Airlines were the first to embrace the new airport with scheduled services, albeit quickly giving up after yielding suboptimal traffic numbers.  In the late 2010s, the administration decided to repurpose Radom as a low-cost airport, which initially drew strong opposition, especially given that the region already had two major airports (Modlin and Chopin).  The new terminal building was completed in 2022 and inaugurated in mid-2023. ​ It’s served by Enter Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Mavi Gök Airlines, and Wizz Air. ​ The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom 3D models, custom ground service equipment, performance-friendly optimization, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. ​ It’s available for free on Contrail, requiring at least 2.41 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Eagle Dynamics Outlines DCS World Roadmap for 2026 and Beyond</title>
    <updated>2026-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has published a comprehensive set of newsletters, detailing what’s ahead for DCS World in 2026 and beyond, combining a forward-looking technical roadmap with a look back at recent campaign releases and what’s still to come. At the core of the 2026 plans is continued work on the long-awaited Dynamic Campaign, with development now heavily focused on strategic and tactical AI behaviour, ground force interactions, and the supporting user interface.  Eagle Dynamics says internal testing is already underway, across multiple maps and force compositions, with tools planned to allow players to interact with Air Tasking Orders, objectives, and mission data in far more depth than before. Another major pillar is the transition to the Vulkan API, described as being in late-stage development. The move is expected to unlock modern rendering features, such as improved frame generation support, expanded DLSS and FSR options, cockpit ray tracing, and better VRAM management.  Alongside this, further performance work, visual effects upgrades, and expanded multi-threading on the simulation side remain in progress. Beyond core engine work, Eagle Dynamics highlighted improvements to weather, explosions, and visual effects, a new navmesh system for better AI ground pathfinding, and a complete overhaul of ATC and radio communications. Mission State Save, introduced in 2025, will also continue to expand, with additional waypoint and AI behaviour data planned to be preserved between sessions. On the content side, 2026 will see continued support for existing aircraft and maps, completion of the Afghanistan and Iraq terrains, and progress on new modules, including the free Flaming Cliffs-level Su-25, alongside longer-term projects, such as the F-15C and F-35A.  The Pacific Theatre of Operations remains a major focus, with the F6F Hellcat, A6M5 Zero, a dedicated WWII Marianas map, and a large PTO assets pack, all forming the foundation for 1944-era operations. Eagle Dynamics also published an extensive campaign retrospective for 2025, highlighting a strong year for single-player content across multiple eras and aircraft, from WWII to modern combat. Looking ahead, a wide range of new training, historical, and story-driven campaigns are already in development for 2026 and beyond, as the ecosystem of third-party campaign creators continues to grow.  Further details are expected in upcoming updates. You can read Part 1 of the roadmap here, Part 2 here, and the Campaign Retrospective here.

Young International Airport (KDET) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Detroit, Michigan, with a yearly average of 32,850 passengers. It opened as Detroit City Airport Terminal in 1927, designed by architect Perry A. Fellows and built by W. E. Wood Co., after five years of searching for an adequate location and carrying on the necessary construction work.  Two years later, the administration built the first hangar, and it quickly rose into Detroit’s main airport at the time. It was Detroit’s main airport until 1947, when Wayne County Metropolitan Airport took over the majority of the flights. That happened in large part because Detroit City Airport couldn’t be expanded further due to a cemetery in the vicinity, which local residents did not agree to demolishing. Traffic kept on dying over the years, with airline service completely ending in 2000 and the airport’s focus shifting over to pilot training and handling private/corporate flights.  The FAA has recently approved a plan to improve the airport’s infrastructure - the first in 30 years - which should theoretically unlock more than 100 million USD in federal funds over the next decade, allowing the administration to work on a new control tower, improved taxiways, and a regulation-compliant safety zone. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-crafted custom assets, custom ground textures, PBR texturing, fully modeled interiors, custom night lighting, and much more. It’s available on OrbxDirect for roughly $13.83, requiring at least 2.77 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Paulo Ricardo has recently released their rendition of Recife/Guararapes—Gilberto Freyre International Airport (SBRF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil, with an average of 9 million passengers per year. It was built during World War 2 to replace an airfield at the same location. In the years following the conflict, it became a strategic technical and refueling stop on routes from South America to Europe. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1958, and its two runways were extended at the time to accommodate larger aircraft. In the late 1970s, an agreement was reached with Infraero (a state-owned airport operator) to further develop the airport, leading to renovations in 1982 and expansion work in the 1990s. A new passenger terminal, including a shopping mall and a concourse, was built in 2004, increasing its passenger handling capacity from 1.5 million a year to 9 million. In late 2009, the government invested 8 million BRL into upgrading the terminal for the 2014 World Cup, adding eight more jetways and modernizing the infrastructure. It’s a hub for Azul Linhas Aéreas and is served by Gol Linhas Aéreas, LATAM Brasil, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas Aéreas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a highly detailed passenger terminal with a partially modeled interior, city landmarks, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. ​ It’s available in the Marketplace (2020 and 2024) for $11.99.

    <title>Kiss Simulation Releases Sarajevo International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Kiss Simulation has recently released their updated rendition of Sarajevo International Airport (LQSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving the city of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and averaging 1.3 million passengers a year. It was built in 1966 and opened for traffic three years later, although domestically. International operations began a year later, with Frankfurt as its first international destination.  The first renovation happened nearly 20 years later for the 1984 Winter Olympics, with a new terminal building, a runway extension, and navigational system improvements. The terminal was expanded in 2017, with a new 10,000-square-meter building capable of handling up to 2 million passengers a year. Its mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather have led to multiple financial losses over the years, most notably in December 2015, when over 40% of flights were canceled. The only way they could fix it would be by moving the threshold an additional 200 meters, which would shorten the runway, which is not ideal given that it’s already relatively short at 2,600 meters.  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, including the new terminal extension, a custom runway profile, a real-world ILS profile, custom-made ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, runway weathering, and more. It’s available on SimMarket for $15.50, requiring at least 1.75 GB of free hard disk space. Owners of the 2020 version are entitled to a free upgrade.
