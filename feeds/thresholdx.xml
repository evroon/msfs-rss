    <title>Airplane Simulation Company Releases C-130J for DCS World</title>
    <updated>2025-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Airplane Simulation Company has released its C-130J Super Hercules for DCS World, landing alongside the latest simulator update, version 2.9.22.17790. The module brings a deeply simulated, fully interactive C130. The Hercules arrives with a clickable cockpit, modern digital avionics, and a detailed simulation of the AE 2100D3 turboprop engines. A standout feature is the first-person loadmaster mode, letting you walk through the cargo bay, move around the exterior, and handle loads directly. The aircraft supports vehicle transport, airdrops, and even deployment of the enormous GBU-43/B MOAB, all enhanced by DCSâs new dynamic cargo system. Thanks to the update, the C-130J can also act as a mobile logistics hub, spawning Forward Arming and Refuelling Points from delivered cargo. Multi-crew is supported at launch, with pilot and co-pilot roles available, and a third station planned.  Airplane Simulation Company notes a few early-access limitations, including occasional visual glitches when unloading cargo, restrictions on re-loading previously unloaded vehicles, and an in-game manual that misbehaves in VR. The C-130J is available now for $63.99 via Steam, the Eagle Dynamics e-shop, and the Airplane Simulation Company website. Read the full DCS 2.9.22.17790 changelog here.

    <title>More Previews of the LevelUp 737NG Series V2Â </title>
    <updated>2025-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/692f2e1a1a9f4eeaae6ac0b3_December-Update%20(1).webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. LevelUp has shared a new development update on the 737NG Series V2 for X-Plane, confirming that V2 Stage 1 has now entered the âFinal Artworkâ phase. According to the team, core development for this first stage is largely complete, and the focus has now shifted to finishing touches, ahead of release later this year. In this phase, the updated aircraft has been handed over to a group of livery artists, who are porting their work to the new 3D model and texture set, while the testing team validates systems and handling. The team notes that the schedule remains on track with the previously announced window, targeting a Stage 1 release before the end of the year. V2 itself is a major refresh of the freeware 737NG Series, bringing a comprehensive visual and audio overhaul, including new high-resolution textures, revised modelling, and an updated sound set.Â  Stage 1 will deliver the bulk of those visual and sound upgrades, while a second stage is planned to introduce an all-new cockpit model and additional refinements, and to lay the groundwork for a future 737 MAX line, built on the same assets. Alongside the written update, LevelUp released two new preview images, highlighting the reworked mode control panel and exterior detailing around the CFM56 engines, wing, and landing gear, giving a closer look at the improved materials and surface work that V2 brings to the aircraft. The 737NG Series remains a freeware download for X-Plane, combining LevelUpâs custom 3D and visual work with systems derived from the popular Zibo mod. Once a firm date for V2 Stage 1 is confirmed, we will share it. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Brazil Land Games Shares New Porto Alegre Airport Previews for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Brazil Land Games has recently shared more images of their work on the Porto Alegre Salgado Filho International Airport (SBPA) update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024. It is the ninth busiest airport in the country, with nearly 8 million passengers yearly (pre-pandemic). Originally called SÃ£o JoÃ£o Federal Airport, it was just an air club, with its first flights dating back to 1923. It saw commercial action for the first time in 1932, when VARIG (the oldest Brazilian airline) replaced their seaplanes with land airplanes, adopting Porto Alegre as their hub. It took eight years to commission an actual passenger terminal. Its current name was adopted in 1952, after Joaquim Pedro Salgado Filho, a local politician who had died a year prior (air crash). Itâs a focus city for Azul Brazilian Airlines, with a significant domestic network (fifteen destinations) and international legs to Punta del Este and Montevideo (Uruguay). The other two Brazilian giants, GOL Linhas AÃ©reas (thirteen domestic destinations) and LATAM Brasil (5 domestic destinations), are also regularly seen around POA. TAP Air Portugal is the sole European visitor, coming from Lisbon. Not much was said, except for the pictures themselves and the fact that itâs still undergoing development.

    <title>Fly 2 High Releases Tulsa International Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>
    <updated>2025-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tulxplane12"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6931cf55e88d9fe77d75f38f_tul1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. âFly 2 High has recently released their rendition of Tulsa International Airport (KTUL) for X-Plane 11 and 12. The airport serves Tulsa, Oklahoma, and has a yearly average of 3.2 million passengers. The airport opened nearly a hundred years ago, in 1928, as Tulsa Municipal Airport. Its initial infrastructure was rather rough, with a one-story wood and tar âterminalâ and landing strips and taxiways made of mown grass. It was busy enough at the time to be the âbusiest airport in the World,â handling nearly 10,000 passengers a month, somehow outpacing Croydon Airport in London, Berlin Tempelhof, and Paris Le Bourget. In the early 1930s, Frederick Kershner designed a new terminal with an elegant Art Deco design, no more wood and tar. That building soldiered on until the 1950s, when the administration realized it was no longer sufficient for the traffic figures, leading to the construction of a new terminal in 1958. The new â and much bigger â terminal opened in 1961, qualifying it to become an International airport two years later. It hosted the 130th Fighter Wing in 1940 during the early stages of World War 2. Within a year of that, the War Department determined that Tulsa would become the site of an Air Force Plant, operated by Douglas Aircraft Corporation to manufacture and assemble bombers from 1942 to 1945. A year after the war, American Airlines purchased two ex-Air Force hangars to start their maintenance facilities in Tulsa, where they had nonstop routes to Los Angeles and San Francisco. In the 1960s, McDonnell Douglas still used the Air Force Plant for aircraft maintenance. The lease ended in 1996, when Boeing acquired it for aerospace manufacturing. The passenger terminal was renovated in the 2010s, designed by Gensler and Benham Companies. The ceilings were raised, passenger waiting areas were improved, and the gates were redesigned. Itâs a hub for Omni Air International and Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, PBR textures, dynamic night lighting, hand-placed objects and vegetation, optional static aircraft, and much more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $13.99, requiring at least 8.91 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>UK2000 Scenery Releases Exeter Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Exeter Airport (EGTE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving the counties of Devon, Cornwall, Somerset, and Dorset, with a yearly average of 382,000 passengers. It was officially opened in early 1937 as an airfield, with a tent serving as the terminal, before the construction of permanent structures would eventually follow. Shortly after its debut, the airport was used by the Royal Air Force as RAF Exeter, where the RAF Fighter Command was based and played a crucial role during the Battle of Britain. It was also used by the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force as a troop transport base for D-Day. Immediately after the war, it was briefly occupied by a French air force fighter squadron serving under the RAF, which departed a year later. By 1947, it had been transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation for civilian use, although some RAF activity continued until the early 1950s. Scheduled services started in 1952, flying people to the Channel Islands and multiple charter destinations. A new terminal was built in the 1980s, along with a runway extension to ensure the safe operation of larger airplanes. The runway was recently resurfaced, and LED lighting was installed, resulting in a significant reduction in operating costs and maintenance. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, PBR materials, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $18.66, requiring at least 63.06 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their fifth pack of Papua New Guinea Highland Bush Strips, featuring seven new airstrips (Dusin, Yomneri, Kanainj, Bank, Kombaku, Ambaluwa, Bundi). Bush airstrips in Papua New Guinea are generally the only gateway to certain remote villages, making them vital to their existence and the primary means of bringing in supplies. The weather is often harsh, the runways are often short and hand-carved, and the challenge is unparalleled. The pack leverages MSFS 2024âs powerful SDK to provide an even more immersive experience.  Each airstrip features their unique terminal buildings, infrastructure, signage, etc., and the developer (Ken Hall) plans to add more stuff in the near future. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.60, requiring at least 2.84 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released Flow Pro and Flow Essentials for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, their popular customizable menu system first seen in late 2022 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. â Originally built to challenge the status quo and offer a new and improved way of accessing and interacting with information within the simulator, Flow quickly became very popular among Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 pilots, who were eager for it to become available in 2024 as well. â The developers had to rebuild the tool due to how much Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 changed under the hood, which led to a few complications at first.  â Flow 2024 is a PC-only release and wonât be available for consoles. Current Flow Pro and Essentials owners are entitled to a $2 upgrade. â Itâs available on their website for $30 (Pro) and $20 (Essentials). The main difference between Essentials and Pro is that Essentials canât be modified, whereas Pro allows for custom scripting.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iBlueYonder has released 7S3 Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing a rebuilt version of the classic Oregon airfield to MSFS 2024.Â  Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark is a small, privately operated general aviation field, operated by the Stark family since 1972. It sits in the Willamette Valley, about 17 nautical miles south-west of Portland International Airport, surrounded by farmland and orchards, with easy VFR routes to the Cascade Range, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Pacific coast. The new version features an accurate airport layout and buildings as of 2025, highly detailed ground polygons, several open hangars for parking, animated people, and animated birds around the field. True to the real location, the sloping, multi-level runway is modelled, and there are plenty of small touches, such as llamas near the airfield, and bespoke night lighting. Features: Starkâs Twin Oaks Airpark for MSFS 2024 is available now via the Contrail app and webshop for $10.68. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. OnAir Airline Manager has launched its Christmas Challenge 2025 event, âOperation Arctic Revitalisationâ. Running from Nov. 26 2025, 0830Z until Dec. 24 2025, 0830Z, the campaign sends pilots on a winter journey across Iceland and the Arctic region, to deliver fragile Healing Vials from ÃsafjÃ¶rÃ°ur Airport (BIIS) to Santaâs âHealing Houseâ, at Ivalo Airport (EFIV). The main mission follows a six-leg route via HÃ³lmavÃ­k, VÃ¡gar, Ãlesund, Mo i Rana, and Kiruna, using event aircraft, provided free of charge on each sector. The vials are carried in a sensitive stabiliser that reacts to harsh manoeuvres, so pilots must fly low, smooth, and precisely. Optional secondary flights deliver Dilithium Units from surrounding airports to keep the stabiliser powered and the mission progressing. Scoring awards 100 points for each completed main leg, plus a bonus based on the remaining condition of the Healing Vial. The top 10 players on the global leaderboard are guaranteed a prize from a pool that includes store vouchers, copies of the PMDG 737 for MSFS 2024, SayIntentions.AI subscriptions, and products from Pilot Experience Sim. Active companies can also earn an in-game credit bonus, based on their event revenue. The Christmas Challenge is open to both existing and new users, with a free seven-day trial of OnAir Airline Manager available for anyone who wants to take part. Full details, tutorials, and background story material are available on the official OnAir website. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Flight Simulation Association has announced several changes for FlightSimExpo 2026, including Friday exhibit hall access for the first time, and new single-day ticket options for attendees who cannot commit to the full three-day show. New for 2026, the exhibit hall at the Saint Paul RiverCentre will open on Friday, 12 June, from 2130Z to 0000Z, directly after #FSExpoFridayâs product reveals and developer updates, which now begin at 1700Z.Â  FSA Co-Founder Evan Reiter said the change is a direct response to attendee feedback, noting that âthis change allows us to offer attendees 20% more time in the exhibit hall without changing the overall travel footprint for our partnersâ. The rest of the weekend schedule remains familiar, with announcements, hands-on exhibits and demonstrations, product updates, developer Q&amp;As, workshops, and more on Saturday and Sunday.Â  Co-Founder Phil Coyle added that the team is planning additional off-site activities, such as tower and airport tours and museum visits, with details to follow in early 2026. Alongside the expanded Friday programme, FlightSimExpo 2026 will introduce new single-day ticket options.  In addition to a full âEntire Eventâ ticket, attendees will be able to purchase Friday-only, Saturday-only, or Sunday-only access, aimed particularly at simmers who cannot attend all three days, especially those local to the MinneapolisâSaint Paul area.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. SimAtlas has officially launched as a subscription service for Microsoft Flight Simulator, offering PC users a new way to access payware add-ons.  For a promotional rate of $12 per month initially, and $16 per month thereafter, subscribers gain access to a library of more than 100 payware products, representing over $1,400 in combined retail value. Content is licensed directly from developers and delivered through a dedicated desktop client, which handles installation, updates, and Community folder management automatically.  The software is designed to work alongside AI traffic packages and GSX, and needs to remain open while MSFS is running.  The team says its goal is to make high-quality content easier to discover, and significantly more affordable to enjoy, while still supporting creators financially, and stresses that SimAtlas does not remove or restrict existing one-time purchase options.  A free demo tier with select freeware content is also available, allowing users to test the platform before committing to a paid plan. For developers, SimAtlas offers a recurring revenue model on top of existing sales channels. Content is wrapped in the clientâs DRM system and remains accessible only to active subscribers, with the company stating that a significant majority of subscription income is returned to participating developers as royalties.  Studios may choose to license a single product or an entire catalogue, and the platform supports all add-on types that live in the Community folder.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the long-awaited Sim Update 4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, introducing substantial performance improvements, numerous bug fixes, and additional enhancements. â With a kilometer-long checklist, Sim Update 4 might just be the most important Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 patch yet, bringing huge improvements to the table, especially on the performance front, where it had been previously lacking, being borderline unplayable on systems with not enough VRAM due to how DirectX 12 handles that by nature, tanking performance and causing stutters. SU4 attempts to lower that footprint slightly, allowing breathing room for it to work without major hiccups here and there. â Furthermore, the update also adds the Boom XB-1 and launches the Red Bull Air Races mode. The complete changelog follows below: â The update is now available on all compatible platforms.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of a native build of their Accu-Sim Comanche 250 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, including new 2024-only features such as the new EFB apps, dirt accumulation, and more. The upgrade - which will be paid for - will bring native 2024 gauges, a native 2024 EFB with charts and other apps, a full walkaround system using 2024âs standards, dirt accumulation on the exterior, dual PMS/TDS GTN 750/650 configuration, time compression support, and much more. The complete feature list follows below: â - Native 2024 gauges and model with optimized LODs - Native 2024 EFB, allowing the tablet to show charts and other EFB apps - Full walkaround using 2024 system - Dirt accumulation on the exterior, persistent between flights - Dual PMS 750/650 and TDS GTNxi 750/650 GPS configurations for those who want more GPS in the cockpit - Narco NS-800 RNAV configuration for those who want less GPS in the cockpit - STEC ST-901 GPSS module for those who want to follow magenta line on autopilot - Optional Asobo G5 electronic instrument retrofit - Other improvements like time compression support â It will be a $14.99 upgrade for MSFS 2020 owners. â They followed up with a brief Q&amp;A regarding specific aspects of the product, such as livery compatibility and persistence files: Persistence (.dat files): Youâll be able to manually copy your 2020 files into the 2024 version to continue your aircraft history. Instructions will be provided at release; feel free to post on the A2A Forums if you need help. â MSFS2020 liveries: They wonât work as-is, but can be updated to 2024 format (similar to the Aerostar transition). â Aircraft replacement: The Native 2024 Comanche replaces the 2020 version for MSFS2024 users. Your MSFS2020 Comanche will continue working for those who want to keep it. â Performance: Accu-Sim prioritises simulation over visuals. Thereâs only so much detail we can add before impacting performance and we tend to push as much as we can to the core simulation elements over the eye candy. The MSFS2024 Native Comanche uses optimized LODs and as a native model, keeping performance at least on par and often slightly improved over the 2020 version. â Marketplace: Paid optional upgrade. Weâll coordinate with store partners so existing customers receive a discount. Marketplace releases usually take longer; the A2A Store and other vendors go live first. â Thereâs still no information on the release date, but more details will be shared in the coming weeks.

    <title>flyt Simulations Updates Jericoacoara Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-12-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. flyt Simulations has recently released a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024-native version of Comandante Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport (SBJE), offering full compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, and additional features. Funded by a government plan to develop regional aviation in Brazil, construction work began in 2011 and concluded three years later. The inauguration, however, only took place in 2017 after a series of organizational mishaps. The passenger terminal, designed by Francisco Antonio Laprovitera Teixeira, consists of a single block with departure and arrival areas, food kiosks, bathrooms at each extremity, andâunfortunatelyâfew check-in desks. Its 2200m runway is long enough to accommodate an Airbus A320 and its Boeing counterpart, the 737-800. â Itâs served by Azul (Belo Horizonte), Azul Conecta (Fortaleza, ParnaÃ­ba), Gol Transportes AÃ©reos (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos), and LATAM Brasil (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos). The update introduces native MSFS 2024 compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, enhanced LOD optimization, new vegetation models, and terrain CGL changes.  â Itâs available in the Marketplace for $9.99.
