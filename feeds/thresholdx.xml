    <summary>Sim: MSFS. X-Codr has recently released their rendition of Denver International Airport for MSFS. This airport, also known as DIA, serves the Denver metropolitan area and Front Range Urban corridor. With over 75,000,000 passenger operations and more than 660,000 aircraft operations per year, DIA is the third busiest airport in the USA and the sixth busiest in the world. After 6 years of construction, DIA was finally open for public use in 1996 and replaced the older Denver Stapleton Airport. The first flight to land at the new airport was United 1474 from Colorado Springs, while the first flight to depart was United 1062, to Kansas City. Originally, the airport had 5 runways: 7/25, 8/26, 16L/34R, 17L/35R, and 17R/35L, and all of them were of the same length: 12,0000ft. This changed in 2003 when 16R/34L was built to accommodate fully loaded A380s and B747s in hot and high conditions. With its length of 16,000ft, only 6 other runways in the world are longer. DIA consists of a single terminal named The Jeppesen Terminal and consists of three concourses: Concourse A - used by Delta Air Lines, Frontier, JetBlue and United Airlines, Concourse B - used by United Airlines and Concourse C - primarily used by Southwest Airlines, as well as American Airlines and regional airlines. More than 30 airlines fly to over 100 destinations across 4 continents from Denver, as well as 7 cargo airlines to 34 destinations, mostly in the USA. X-Codrâs rendition of Denver International Airport features Highly detailed models and high-resolution textures, Custom models for all airport buildings, modelled terminal interiors, custom jetways textures, high-quality ground textures, blended orthoimagery, custom animated runway guard and wig-wag lights, accurate airport data, âup-to-date airport layout, and performance optimisation. â This scenery is available for purchase on OrbxDirect for roughly $22.15 and will require at least 8.50GB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flightsim news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has recently previewed an update to the Flaming Cliffs franchise.Â  Flaming Cliffs is a pack of less-detailed aircraft made for players who prefer a straightforward experience, without complex systems. Some of the well-known FC aircraft are MiG-29, A-10A, and Su-27. The FC2024 update will include three planes: F-5E, F-86F and MiG-15bis.Â  F-5E is an exceptionally capable aircraft for air combat and unguided ground strikes. Equipped with âSidewindersâ and cannons for dogfights, the F-5E also has a BVR (beyond visual range) radar. F-86F was one of the best fighter jets during the Korean War.Â  Armed with 50-calibre machine guns for dogfighting and early infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. Aside from Air-to-Air, F-86F can also be equipped with unguided bombs and rockets for air-to-ground attacks. MiG-15bis was also one of the most revolutionary fighters, also one of the best fighters in the Korean War. It was unrivalled and would outmatch every aircraft in a dogfight until the F-86F Sabre came. Small and light plane, but a tough fighter. Its armament included two 23mm guns and a 37mm cannon. Existing Flaming Cliffs 3 owners can upgrade to the new update for $9.99 until the end of July when the upgrade fee will increase to $14.99. F-5E, F-86F and MiG-15bis can also be individually purchased for $14.99 each.Â  The exact release date is unknown, however, we know for a fact that it will come with the new DCS update. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news! â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has just released their rendition of Keflavik International Airport for MSFS. Serving the Greater Reykjavik Area, Keflavik International Airport has more than 7,500,000 passenger operations and more than 75,000 aircraft movements yearly. Built by the United States Military during WWII, the airport served as a replacement for British airfields in the northern part of Iceland. It consisted of two separate runways built 4km apart. After the war, the Meeks Field was renamed to Naval Air Station Keflavik, and in 1951, the US military returned to the airport. After the military air base in Keflavik was reestablished, passengers had to pass several military checkpoints before boarding the aircraft until 1987, when the separate civilian terminal was built. Two 10,000ft (3,000m) long runways are 200ft (60m) wide, which is enough to accommodate AN-225 and even a NASA Space Shuttle. This airport is also an important alternative in case of emergency during trans-Atlantic flights. Despite the low population of Iceland, it is a popular destination among travellers from both Europe and North America. Keflavik International Airport is a hub of two airlines: Icelandair - the flag carrier of Iceland, and PLAY - a low-cost airline. It also serves 25 airlines that fly to more than 80 destinations in the USA and Europe, as well as more than 35 seasonal destinations, mostly in Europe. Aside from passenger airlines, Icelandair Cargo flies to Boston, Liege and Los Angeles from Keflavik. MK Studios rendition of the airport features a detailed rendition of Keflavik Airport (BIKF) and Reykjavik Airport (BIRK), the up-to-date layout of the airport, custom jetways and vehicle models, modelled terminal interior, custom runway and taxiway lights and custom taxiway markings. This scenery is available for purchase on the IniBuilds store for roughly $18.98, but for the first 7 days after release, there will be a 5% discount ($18.08). It will also require at least 1.93GB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. In a press release provided to Threshold, Nicki Repenning of Honeycomb Aeronautical provides an update on the progress of the Charlie Rudder Pedals, management of Honeycomb, and RMA units for those who have returned their products.  Starting off with the replacement units, Mr. Repenning says that over the past few months, heâs âbeen trying to find a solution to replace approximately 110 faulty units that were sent out to customers and have been returned,â but has run into issues due to his former business partner, Mike Steup of Snakebyte-group, not replacing customerâs faulty units. As an alternative, Repenning says that he has been able to obtain replacement products that he will start shipping out to customers July 15th, and he plans to have them all shipped by the end of July. As for the Charlie pedal pre-orders, both Mr. Reppening and his former business partner at Snakebyte have started production of the pedals at different factories. According to Snakebyte, they will start shipping to customers on June 24th, but customers are still waiting for confirmation on the shipping. If that does not pan out, Reppening says, pre-order customers will get an email with an âalternative solution.â Furthermore, Mr. Reppening addresses questions about the future of management at Honeycomb. Reppening explains, âAfter months of trying to find a new partner to buy out my former partnerâs interest in Honeycomb, I realized that it wasnât a task I was able to handle by myself,â and he has âengaged capable business and legal advisors who are helping me move forward.â He continues to say that both Snakebyte and Honeycomb are working towards a â solution that doesnât require litigation and they [Repenningâs advisors] have done an excellent job,â and that he believes that âwe [Honeycomb] are in the home stretch and will come to an agreement soon on the terms by which I will regain ownership and management of the full Honeycomb business.â Reppening adds that he hopes to make an announcement on that situation soon, but is cautious and is ânot counting my chickens yet.âAdditionally, Mr. Reppening says that he is at FSExpo 2024 in Vegas, and he is open to questions, but he will be âdoing an AMA in the coming weeks, so everyone else will have the chance to do the same.â Reppening reports that they âhave the first production units ready to ship but will also bring ten units to FS Expo which I will personally hand deliver at the show.â As for the second run of production, that will âbe ready at the end of July and will be made available for purchase once the factory has confirmed the shipping date to us.â Finally, Mr. Reppenning thanks the community for âthe incredible support that I and my team have received,â and he says that they âhave also read the comments from people who have been critical and have taken that to heart.â He ends off with a message to the community, saying that âThe only thing we can do right now is to look ahead, learn from the past and stay optimistic about the future,â and that if customers have any question for him, they can email him at: AskNicki@HoneycombSim.com. As for his former business partner at Snakebyte-group, they have not followed up on any questions in a request for comment sent by Threshold.Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FS Designs recently released an upgraded rendition of Pensacola International Airport (KPNS) for X-Plane 12. It is the second-busiest airport in North Florida, with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers. Pensacola got its first passenger terminal in 1935, with commercial service to begin two years later with Atlantic and Gulf Airlines, although very short-lived due to financial issues. National Airlines took over in 1938 with flights to Mobile and Jacksonville. World War 2 saw the airport become a US Navy training facility, granting it a new control tower and runway.Â  The terminal was expanded 12 years ago at $35 million, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and modernizing the infrastructure. There are talks of a new concourse and parking expansion to come shortly. American Airlines, American Express, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. Delta tops the market share chart with 26.04%, followed by Southwest and PSA Airlines with 21.63% and 10.87%, respectively. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ortho imagery, high-quality 3D modeling, animated hangars, reworked textures, PBR texturing, custom 4K ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, up-to-date layout, and wear and tear effects using the latest technology. Itâs available on their store for $14.99, requiring at least 1.61 GB of free hard disk space to install. V1 owners are eligible for a 50% discount.

The airport serves Charlotte, North Carolina, and has a yearly average of 53.4 million passengers, making it the sixth busiest in the country. It opened 85 years ago as Charlotte Municipal Airport, funded by Works Progress Administration funding. It was the largest WPA project at the time, featuring a terminal, three runways, a hangar, and a beacon tower. â The USAF took control of the airport shortly after due to World War 2, establishing an Air Force Base. Over 5 million USD were invested between 1941 (when the takeover happened) and 1946 when it was handed back to the city. A 6,500 square meter terminal was built in 1954 to accommodate the ever-increasing passenger numbers. It had two floors, with passenger operations confined to the ground floor.Â  â Major renovation work started in the late 1960s to keep up with the harsh demands of the jet age and become a major player in domestic traffic. This led to its eventual consolidation as a hub after the airline deregulation of 1978.Â  A new 30,200 square meter terminal was built by Piedmont Airlines in 1979 and inaugurated three years later.Â  â In 1990, a 7,400-square-meter international concourse was built, followed by an expansion of the central terminal building.Â  A regional concourse was built in the early 2000s, adding a 32-gate concourse (Concourse E). â Expansion work followed in 2015 with âCLT 2015â, a 2.5 billion USD investment to modernize and accommodate the envisioned passenger figures for the following decade and beyond.Â  The airport currently has 115 gates on five concourses, all connected to the central terminal building. Itâs a hub for American Airlines and is also served by Air Canada Express, Contour Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and Volaris. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 3D interiors, PBR textures, dynamic lighting, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. â Itâs available on the X-Plane.org Store for roughly $26.95, requiring at least 2.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SPINOZA has recently released their version of Albert Whitted Airport (KSPG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport is located in and serves the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, which is renowned as the birthplace of the first scheduled commercial airline flight. Situated in the Tampa Bay area, the airport features a total of two runways. Construction of Albert Whitted Airport began in 1928, and the airport officially opened in 1929. In 1934, National Airline initiated service to the airport, but this ceased after World War II when the airline shifted operations to St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport. Upon its opening in 1929, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company stationed one of its airships at Albert Whitted Airport, marking it as one of the first airports to serve as a base for their blimps. Over the years, a Coast Guard Air Station was also established at the airport. Today, the airport remains a popular choice for general aviation in the area. The recently released scenery package provides Microsoft Flight Simulator users with a variety of features for the Florida-located airport. The newly released Albert Whitted Airport is now available on SimMarket for approximately $18.34 and requires 487.25 MB of storage space.
