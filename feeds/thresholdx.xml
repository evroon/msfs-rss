    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In partnership with Thranda Design, Just Flight has developed a rendition of the Piper PA-28R for X-Plane 12, featuring a highly detailed simulation of the popular four-seater first introduced in 1976. As the name suggests, the PA-28R Arrow III is the third iteration of the Piper Arrow lineup. It was launched in 1967 with the PA-28R-180, followed by the Arrow II. Five years later, it was majorly upgraded with a semi-tapered wing, larger fuel tanks (meaning increased range), and several other improvements and commercialized under the Arrow III moniker.  The add-on features high-quality 8K texturing throughout, reworked PBR materials, a brand new EFB tablet with aircraft configuration states, checklists, and customization options, a dynamic livery feature with color, design, and dirt level change on the fly, a high-quality FMOD sound set, and much more.Â  Itâs available on Just Flightâs website for roughly $42.99, requiring at least 2.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued an update to their newly released Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator, addressing some WASM crashes, FMC bugs, and geometry fixes.Â  They also anticipate a series of updates in the next 14 days, aiming to mitigate user experience-disrupting issues (primarily), and the other teams (model, art, and sound) will also push their fixes. What hasnât been fixed yet is an SU15-induced issue plaguing their 737 and 777, causing both to freeze entirely and stop responding. They have been working with Asobo to find out the root cause, and âvictimsâ are encouraged to file a support ticket with PMDG so they can be surveyed.Â  Update 2.00.0034, issued via Operations Center, addresses the CLR bug that plagued many day one 777 pilots; hitting cancel on the EICAS no longer freezes the aircraft, and many model adjustments were made. The changelog follows below: â The next update is already being tested and will fix long directory names preventing the installation process from working altogether.Â  The Triple Seven is available on PMDG.com for $77.73.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iFly has recently published a new development update for their upcoming Boeing 737 Max 8 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring a gallery with over 30 preview images. Other than the images (which say more than a thousand words, one could argue), iFly claims the development is moving along nicely. They have been considering creating a Discord channel to keep everyone updated on the project as it progresses. The 737Max is Boeingâs response to the A320Neo. It has bigger, high-tech, and very efficient engines, a different wing, and a completely new glass cockpit while operating in a similar fashion to its previous iteration, the 737NG. With that, airlines save money in training costs as the commonality is retained.Â  Thereâs no pricing or release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TFDi, a development group well-known for their products such as B717 and PACX, have just released the trailer for the long-awaited MD-11. Unveiled yesterday on TFDiâs YouTube channel, it showcased the progress through years of development, with an interesting song choice in the background.Â  The trailer previewed mostly internal and external visuals, unfortunately, we couldnât hear any sounds. We could see that significant effort has been made by the developer team in modelling and texturing. At the very end of the video, we could see the release date - 2nd July! TFDiâs MD-11 Base Pack will cost $69.99 (cargo or passenger), while the Expansion pack (conveniently named The One You Did Not Purchase Already), is priced at $9.99. Later in 2024, the Extended Simulation Package will also be available for purchase. The package will include operational failures, an advanced custom failures menu, and circuit breaker functionality. The MD-11 will be compatible with MSFS, P3Dv4/v5/v6, although support for MSFS2024 still hasnât been officially confirmed until the developers receive more information about the upcoming simulator. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flightsim news and high-quality reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TFDi has recently released their rendition of the passenger and cargo variants of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for Microsoft Flight Simulator (and Prepar3d), an ETOPS-capable trijet introduced in 1990 and still in use by many cargo airlines around the World.Â  The original idea behind the MD-11 development was to take the DC-10 as a baseline and modernize it with the latest and greatest in technology from the early 90s, albeit without going overboard given McDonnellâs financial situation, which led to suboptimal fuel efficiency in comparison with the soon-to-be rivals at the time (Airbus A330/A340, Boeing 777), but with greater maximum range, even if briefly (which made it a relatively short-lived airplane, with only 200 units built).Â  The timing couldnât have been worse for a brand-new trijet, as airlines were already prioritizing fuel-efficient twin-engine airplanes and slowly phasing out their fuel-guzzling three, four-engine jets. Unsurprisingly enough, the MD-11 didnât take off in orders. TFDIâs rendition brings the General Electric engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney option to come later), with custom modeled systems, a custom-built flight management computer, high-resolution texturing, high-detail cabins (pax and cargo), and an onboard EFB allowing you to control payload and change specific settings.Â  Their âa la carteâ pricing model allows you to pick only the variant(s) you want: both cost $69.99 (cargo or passenger), and the other variant can be obtained for an extra $9.99, making it $80 for both. An â extended simulation packageâ is set to be released in late 2024, adding failures and circuit breakers. The base packages can be found on TFDiâs website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TropicalSim has recently launched the V2 version of its Martinique AimÃ© CÃ©saire International Airport (TFFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Situated close to Fort-de-France, the capital city of Martinique, the airport is about 6 miles away from the city center. It serves just under 1.9 million passengers annually. The airport opened in 1950 and initially had limited traffic due to the island's reliance on maritime transport for its economy. However, after a decade, air traffic increased, leading to the CCIM being awarded the contract for managing and developing the airport in 1965. Further upgrades were completed in 1995 after construction began in 1991. The airport was renamed in 2007 and is currently a focus city for Air CaraÃ¯bes and Air Antilles Express. Together with other airlines, the airport offers destinations such as Miami, Paris, and Frankfurt, with an average yearly passenger count of just under 1.9 million. The V2 scenery of the airport includes a highly detailed rendition of the airport, full night illumination, dynamic lighting, animated jetways, use of PBR, and more.Â  The new V2 of Martinique Airport is available on SimMarket for around $17.84. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Veco Simulations have recently released the trailer for their first community mod for DCS - T-38A Talon.Â  T-38 Talon is a two-seat, twinjet supersonic jet trainer produced by Northrop Corporation between 1961 and 1972. It was the first supersonic jet trainer, as well as the most produced jet trainer. After more than 63 years since its introduction, it has trained over 72,000 pilots in USAF and other NATO nations air forces, during the joint-training programs. Due to SDK limitations, the development group decided to focus on the 1970s avionic configuration, which will allow them to add every functionality, without the need for other modules or sacrificing fidelity. The mentioned configuration features a functional UHF radio, intercom for communication between pilot and instructor in the back seat, TACAN, ILS, and a mechanical Flight Director system. Veco Simulationsâ rendition of T-38 will be released as a free standalone, full-fidelity, community mod. The trailer provided us with amazing shots of the aircraft's exterior and short sneak peeks of the untextured model of the cockpit.Â  Currently, we have no feature list as of now, but we do however have an estimated release date! At the very end of the trailer, we could see 2025, which could be the possible release year. As of now, no more information about the release date has been released, however, as always, Threshold will keep you updated!Â  â Stay tuned to Threshold for flight sim news!</summary>

Parallel 42 has recently announced a release date for their upcoming 777 Immersion package for Microsoft Flight Simulator - part of their SimFX add-on - aiming to improve the overall realism of the effects within the simulator, including condensation, new particle effects, and more. Available as a single package for all major renditions of the triple seven airframe regardless of the livery used, bringing immersive effects for the PMDG and CaptainSim (at a later date) and customized for each with performance as their top priority.Â  Built on the SimFx framework, it offers the best combination of effects and customizability via the SimFx interface. For the unaware, Parallel 42âs SimFX is a visual effects utility covering a range of immersive scenarios. Every particle on the screen is authentically governed by environmental variables and formulas, and dynamic effects appear under the right conditions, creating unique moments in the virtual skies. The effects include contrails, heat blurs, wing wash, rotor wash, and more. Their immersion package for the 777 builds on top of what SimFx already offers, bringing nineteen custom effects for the mighty triple seven, including swirling contrails, condensation effects, waste water drain every hour, engine cold start effects, fuel jettison, cloud illumination, hot brakes smoke, carbon brake dust, and water droplets. The APU heat blur and the St. Elmoâs fire are not supported because of a development choice by PMDG, using a deprecated technique preventing SimFX or 777 Immersion from injecting their version of those effects. The package will be available for $15.00 on Friday (July 12). Club 42 members are eligible to purchase an early access version of the product.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
