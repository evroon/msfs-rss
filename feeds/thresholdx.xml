    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rafael Tango Tango has recently released their rendition of Recife/GuararapesâGilberto Freyre International Airport (SBRF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Recife in Pernambuco, Brazil, with a yearly average of 9 million passengers. It was built during World War 2 to replace an airfield at the same location. In the years following the conflict, it became a strategic technical and refueling stop on routes from South America to Europe. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1958, and its two runways at the time were extended to accommodate larger aircraft. In the late 1970s, an agreement was reached with Infraero (a state-owned airport operator) to develop the airport further, which led to a renovation in 1982 and expansion work in the 1990s. A new passenger terminal, including a new shopping mall and a new concourse, was built in 2004, increasing its passenger handling capabilities from 1.5 million a year to 9 million. In late 2009, the government invested 8 million BRL into upgrading the terminal for the 2014 World Cup, adding eight more jetways and modernizing the infrastructure. Itâs a hub for Azul Linhas AÃ©reas and is served by Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, LATAM Brasil, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, a custom 3D-modeled passenger terminal, custom jetways, custom autogen for the city, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $6.55, requiring at least 263.59 MB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently released their rendition of VitÃ³ria âEurico de Aguiar Salles International Airport (SBVT) and its surroundings for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves VitÃ³ria in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 3.2 million passengers. Originally built in the 1930s, it would not receive its first passenger terminal and paved runway until a decade later. Heavy renovation work, including a new passenger terminal and runway, was carried out in 2005. Although scheduled to be completed in 2007, several scandals led to a "temporary" halt for nearly a decade. Construction work only resumed in 2015 and concluded three years later, in 2018, sixteen years after the original planning.Â  A few years before the resumption of the expansion works, the airport's operator, Infraero, deemed it the country's worst airport. âOperated by Zurich Airports AG since 2019, the new airport finally meets international standards and swiftly leaves its dark past behind. Azul (Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Recife), Gol (BrasÃ­lia, Porto Seguro, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, SÃ£o Paulo), Latam (BrasÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo), and Voepass (Porto Seguro) serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a highly detailed terminal, city POIs, custom ground clutter, custom ambient sounds, custom terraforming, and more. It's available in the MSFS Marketplace for roughly $8.99 (on sale for $6.49).Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios recently released their rendition of Naha Airport (ROAH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Okinawa Prefecture and has a yearly average of 21. 5 million passengers. The Imperial Japanese Army built the airport in 1933 as Oroku Aerodrome. The United States took it over in 1945 and renamed it Naha Airport. Scheduled service started two years later with Pan American World Airways and Northwest Orient.Â  Refurbishment work began in the early 1950s, bringing the structure up to the standards of the time. In the early 1980s, the US military transferred control of the airport to Japanese forces, which then developed it. The first major upgrade happened in the 1990s, with a main passenger terminal expansion.Â  Further development started in 2008 when the government agreed to expand the domestic terminal and construct a new parallel runway. The expansion required a new international terminal, which opened in 2014, and the construction of the new parallel runway started around that same year. The new international terminal was expanded again in 2016, gaining another 3000 square meters.Â  The new runway started operation in 2020 after nearly six years of construction. Itâs a hub for Japan Transocean Air and Ryukyu Air Commuter and a focus city for All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, and Peach. Air China, Asiana Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, EVA Air, HK Express, Hong Kong Airlines, Jeju Air, Jetstar Asia, Juneyao Air, Korean Air, Spring Airlines, Starlux Airlines, and Tigerair Taiwan also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a highly detailed terminal, various POIs, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom vehicle models, custom runway profile and elevation data, a high-quality terminal interior, custom taxiway labels, and more. Itâs available on Contrail and OrbxDirect for roughly $17.50, requiring at least 2.39 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Previews Warsaw Chopin Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design recently previewed their upcoming rendition of Warsaw Chopin Airport (EPWA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Warsaw Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18.5 million passengers, roughly 40% of the countryâs total air passenger traffic. Urban development in the mid-1920s led to air traffic complications around Warsawâs former aerodrome, leading to the need to build a new airport elsewhere. A decade later, a new airport was finally ready to roll, built near the village of Okecie. It featured a ticket office, customs post, police station, newspaper kiosk, restaurant, and viewing terraceâstate-of-the-art infrastructure for early 1930 standards.Â  Right after the civilian infrastructure was considered ready, they began developing its military potential with the construction of a Polish Air Force base, an Institute of Aviation building, an aircraft-building plant, and other military-related structures. In the late 1930s, the airport was equipped with radio navigation equipment to aid pilots during low-visibility conditions.Â  World War 2 wholly destroyed the airport, which happened to be a battleground between the Germans and the Polish Resistance. It was a bombing target from day one and was occupied by the Luftwaffe as soon as Germany took the country over.Â  The Germans built their first concrete runways and taxiways, which remained undamaged until the final days of the war when they were deliberately destroyed to prevent the enemies from using them. â After the war, LOT Polish Airlines resumed operations at what used to be the airport, kicking off the reconstruction efforts. In two years, they have built a new terminal, a new control tower, and many aircraft parking stands, making it ready to serve people again. â The airportâs terminal was reconstructed between 1964 and 1969 after LOT transferred its maintenance rights to state administration. By 1970, it already hit the one millionth passenger mark. It made them realize that their new terminal was already too small, leading to the construction of a temporary arrival hall, and a pre-war structure was used for domestic operations. â While passenger numbers slightly declined in the early 1980s, the mid-80s and beyond were the opposite, urging the administration to expand the airport even further.The expansion plans from the late 1980s only got started after the fall of communism in the early 1990s. The new terminal was finally brought to life at the cost of 300 million German marks, using 164 subcontractors and 24 months of work. With a maximum capacity of 3.5 million passengers, it could handle 3.5 more people than the previous terminal, which was more than enough at the time. A new terminal (North Hall) was built in 2008, featuring a considerably larger footprint. It now handles arrivals for Star Alliance and Oneworld Airlines. â Itâs a hub for LOT Polish Airlines and a focus city for Enter Air, Smartwings Poland, SprintAir, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Air China, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, flydubai, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Qatar Airways, TAP Air Portugal, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery will feature custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom ground service equipment, custom landside buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. â Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but itâs said to be âturning baseâ (coming soon!).Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently issued a new X-Plane 12 beta build, which brings new boats, fresh custom airports, double jetway support, new cameras, bug fixes, and more.Â  New boats were added to the X-Plane world, increasing the immersion when flying around islands and coastal areas. Ships feature region-specific accuracy, warranting that extra bit of realism. The number of boats shown will depend on the World Objects Density setting within the graphics setting.Â  They have also added three new hand-built airports in the Caribbean, with custom buildings and ground textures: Princess Juliana International Airport (TNCM), Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport (TNCS), and Gustaf III Airport (TFFJ).Â  This update also represents a major milestone for their Scenery Gateway, as the simulator now ships with 20 thousand 3D airports built by the community. Additional camera commands were also added, with General Aviation pilots in mind. The first two commands allow you to tilt the cockpit view by 45 degrees to the left and right, and executing them again will tilt it by another 45 degrees. Commands to look up and down were also added. The camera tilts 30 degrees upon execution, and executing them again will make you look 60 or 90 degrees up or down. By popular demand, Laminar has added dual jetway support, making widebody operations much more realistic. Aircraft and airport authors can now update their products to use this feature. Â  Lastly, new items were added to their general airport library, such as passenger stairs, airport buses, and a ground power unit. The remainder of the changelog follows below: Support for VirtualFly Hardware Included with 12.1.2 is support of four additional products VirtualFly in X-Plane: - Switcho Engines Ignition - Switcho Engines Electrical - Switcho Lights - Switcho Trims â Fixes and Enhancements â Replay System We have focused effort on improving the stability of our replay system for this release. What good is a butter landing if you canât show it to your friends later? â Local Web API When the WebServer cannot bind to port 8086 a warning will be shown to the user, but X-Plane will continue to start normally. â Scenery We updated the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas. â Aircaft â  General We fixed a problem regarding rain drops on windshields (XPD-15751).  Cirrus Vision SF50 We fixed an engine behavior bug in the Cirrus VisionJet. Previously, if you started the engine, shut it down and then immediately tried to start it again, nothing happened.  Beta ALIA VTOL The ALIA 250 now has gauges for all four batteries on its display. â Refer to their blog post for further instructions on installing the beta.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Astralis Studios has recently released their rendition of Ocean Reef Club Airport (07FA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a private-use airport serving Key Largo, Florida. The Ocean Reef Club opened for business in 1951 on top of what used to be the Dispatch Creek Fishing Camp. The former structure consisted of four cabins, several docks, and a small harbor. It was then transformed into a proper club, accessible via land, sea, and air. Once upon a time, the airport even had scheduled passenger air service, with Ocean Reef Airways flying passengers to Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Charters. It was successful at first, with route expansions throughout the 1970s. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date airport layout, custom buildings, custom houses, custom ground markings, Select Club facilities, and handcrafted airport surroundings. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $12, requiring at least 493.5 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Just Flight Releases Development Update for RJ Professional</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight have released another development update on their website for an upcoming product for MSFS - RJ Professional. â The newest update focuses on the cabin and all the differences in cabins between BAe 146 and RJ. The cabin in RJ is also modelled in a 3-3 seat layout, although with grey leather seats, compared to the blue fabric seats in the 146 version.Â  The cabins are custom-modelled for each variant of RJ (RJ70, RJ85 and RJ100), and take all the small differences between them into account, such as blanked-out windows, smaller stowage bins where the wing structure and fuel tanks are located, as well as reduction of seats in rows as the fuselage starts narrowing at the rear. As usual, Just Flight developers have modelled and coded the smallest details in the cabin - both forward and aft galleys are interactive, cabin-to-cockpit communication, and of course, the beloved âstudy-levelâ coffee-maker.Â  The changes in the galley were also made. The bulky communication panel that can be found in 146 Professional is replaced with a simple handset in RJ Professional. Using the headset, you can call the rear or forward galley, cockpit, or passenger cabin. Chimes and annunciators are also included at each station. On the right-hand side of the cabin, the attendant panel can be found. It is used to check the status of the doors, turn on/off seatbelts and no smoking signs, and connect the cabin with the electrical power supplied by the GPU. The layout of this panel is different in RJ, as there are two additional switches that control the cabin lighting. If you arenât a big fan of getting involved in the passenger simulation, developers have you covered! The EFB will include an option named âAuto Cabin Crewâ, and when enabled, the virtual cabin crew will automatically take care of all cabin duties, while you prepare the aircraft for the flight. Speaking of the cabin duties, the boarding and deboarding music will be played via the cool little digital player, which is also in 146 Professional. It allows you to play one of seven default tunes, while you can add your own custom music if you fancy full immersion while flying real-world flights, or just want to relax in the cabin during the cruise with your favourite songs. According to the developers, the rest of the product is finished and has entered the âpolishingâ phase, where RJ will undergo intensive testing and ensure that it is ready for release. Unfortunately, no information about the release date or pricing has been released, but as always, Threshold will keep you updated! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>
