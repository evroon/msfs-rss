    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Cape Town International Airport (FACT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the city of Cape Town, South Africa, and has a yearly average of 10 million passengers. It opened in 1954, replacing the cityâs previous airport, Wingfield Aerodrome. From humble beginnings as a domestic airport, it quickly reached international status with the introduction of a direct flight to Britain. In the early 1990s, the airportâs ownership was transferred from the state to a private company (Airports Company South Africa), and it was renamed a politically neutral âCape Town International Airportâ instead of the pre-apartheid âD. F. Malan Airport.â Growth skyrocketed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, from 6.2 million annually in 2005 to 8.4 million between 2007 and 2008.Â  The airport underwent its first major expansion in 2010 in preparation for the World Cup. This expansion consisted of developing a central terminal building linking the domestic and international terminals and greatly expanding its passenger handling capabilities. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, a true-to-life airport landside, custom night lighting, 180+ handcrafted models, custom high-definition jetways, and more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $20.23, requiring at least 6.59 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has unveiled its next airport project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, FrankfurtâHahn (EDFH). The team shared a first look via Facebook, showing sneak peeks of the airportâs ATC tower. FrankfurtâHahn comes with an interesting history. Once a United States Air Force base during the Cold War, Hahn was home to F-16 squadrons and more than 13,000 personnel. After the base closed in 1993, the German government converted it into a civilian airport.Â  By the early 2000s, low-cost carriers, most notably Ryanair, had established a strong presence, marketing the airport as a more affordable alternative to Frankfurt Airport. With a 3,800-metre runway, it is capable of handling wide-body aircraft and serves as a base for a range of low-cost and cargo carriers. MM Simulations has yet to share a feature list, release date, or pricing, but with development already showing detailed tower modelling, a full reveal does not seem far off.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has released the Impulse 100, also known as the âPocket Rocketâ, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The aircraft is a single-engine, experimental design, known for its nimbleness and performance, and powered by a 450 shp Allison turbine. Thanks to being wrapped in lightweight, carbon-honeycomb composite materials, the Impulse 100 has a thrust-to-weight ratio, thatâs unusual for a two-seat prop aircraft. iniBuilds describes the aircraft as having been developed with âcareful attention to detail,â featuring custom-tuned flight dynamics, intended to replicate its nimble, high-performance nature.Â  Beyond handling, the model includes a detailed electrical and fuel system, complete with functional circuit breakers, and a turbine engine simulation that accounts for hot starts, ITT behaviour, and failure conditions. The cockpit comes fitted with Working Titleâs G1000 NXi suite, with custom engine and system pages, as well as annunciation support. A variety of animations, from gear flex to canopy operation, are included, alongside rain, icing, exhaust heat, and smoke effects. Six liveries are provided by default, each paired with a distinct interior. The full feature list can be read here: Aircraft Features: For the full details, you can read iniBuilds' Blog Post here. The Impulse 100 Pocket Rocket is now available for both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024 via the iniBuilds Store, priced at $16.22 (excluding taxes).

    <title>FlightSim Studio Provides Q3 Update, Updates 727</title>
    <updated>2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fssq3u"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68d569c8447617c919325db2_Q3-header.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlightSim Studio has provided a roundup of its current projects following the summer break, released 727 Super27 expansion, as well as given some updates, on the newly confirmed 727-100, the E-Jets closed beta, and native MSFS 2024 Tecnam updates. The 727 Super27 expansion has now released, and FSS also provided two posts that detailed visual refreshes and system work. The headline change is an EFIS fit, paired with a new autopilot, that adds VNAV modes and RNAV approaches.Â The 727 has now also been updated to v1.1.3. Documentation is already available, and creators should have access to preview content. As a reminder, Super27 is an expansion that requires a base 727 installation (passenger or freighter).Â  The EFIS and new autopilot operate with the GNS-XLS and remain optional, while the digital VSI with TCAS can be used in the base 727 when Super27 is installed. Alongside that, the studio has formally begun work on the 727-100. The plan covers a dedicated freighter and a dedicated passenger variant; convertible models are not currently planned. A Super27 treatment for the -100 is under consideration for later, but the immediate priority is to bring the variant fully into the sim first. On the E-Jets side, closed beta testing continues, with a focus on LNAV/VNAV, performance prediction, and autopilot behaviour. Issues highlighted by testers include waypoint skipping on the lateral path, intermittent drops on the vertical profile, autothrottle oscillation during step climbs, take-off Flight Director sequencing, and unreliable fuel and time estimates.Â  Two departure-routing bugs have been resolved internally, though other items remain. The team is also integrating Navigraph data into the new MCDU to replace problematic stock data. This work has slowed some bug-fixing, but is expected to reduce nav-data-related reports once complete. VNAV logic already follows generated vertical profiles, handles step climbs and pre-TOD descents, and can fly RNAV approaches; however, VNAV is not enabled in the current closed beta, as stability and path generation are being improved first. Finally, the Tecnam P2006T and P2012 are being prepared as native Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 releases. The P2006T is set to receive an enhanced 3D model, new textures, improved flight dynamics, a new FS24 EFB, and a native walkaround.Â  The P2012 is due for improved sounds, an FS24 EFB, and a native walkaround. Flight Sim Studios has not provided release windows for these aircraft, noting that timelines depend on parallel work elsewhere.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has, in conjunction with World Update 20, released Local Legend 22, bringing Japanâs post-war NAMC YS-11 airliner to both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024.Â  Developed by the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation in the late 1950s, the YS-11 first flew in 1962 and entered service three years later. A straightforward, robust design, low wing, pressurised cabin, and tricycle gear helped it find work with civil and military operators worldwide.Â  Power comes from a pair of Rolls-Royce Dart Mk. 542-12K turboprops, driving four-blade, constant-speed propellers, giving the YS-11 plenty of short-field capability. In the simulator, the YS-11 is offered in two variants, Passenger and VIP Charter, and comes with a set of period-appropriate liveries. Performance figures presented with the release include a service ceiling of 23,000 feet, a maximum range of 1,485 miles, and a typical cruise speed of nearly 294 mph.Â  The YS-11 also boasts impressive take-off and landing distances of 3,642 feet and 2,165 feet, respectively. For the full read, you can find Microsoft's blog post here. Local Legend 22 is now available via the in-sim marketplace for $19.99, with rental options including a seven-day pass for $9.99, a three-day pass for $6.99, and a one-day free trial.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aeroplane Heaven has recently taken to Facebook to tease yet another project, providing a set of work-in-progress screenshots that reveal the legendary de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito. This reveal lands days after the developer officially announced its B-25J Mitchell, meaning Aeroplane Heaven now has two iconic World War II bombers for MSFS in the pipeline.Â  Nicknamed the âWooden Wonderâ (or simply the âMossieâ), the Mosquito was one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the Second World War. It had a plywood construction, twin Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, and was a fast, agile, and adaptable aircraft, serving as a bomber, night fighter, pathfinder, and reconnaissance platform.  It even carried out some of the warâs most daring precision strikes, like the famous Amiens Prison raid. The early screenshots showcase a nicely detailed cockpit, complete with scuffed paint, weathered fittings, and authentic wartime instrumentation.Â  Itâs a world of chunky levers, green-painted panels, and exposed wiring, showing off what Aeroplane Heaven is well known for. Externals also make an appearance, giving us a peek at the landing gear and fuselage lines, that defined the Mosquitoâs unmistakable profile. Aeroplane Heaven has kept specifics close to its chest. We donât yet know which Mosquito variants will be modelled, or what the release timeline will be. From the look of things, the 3D modelling phase is well underway, but the larger details are still under wraps.  Weâll keep you updated on the Aeroplane Heaven Mosquito!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Orbx has recently released version 1.13.3 of their Volanta plug-in, a free, flight-tracking application for desktop and mobile, introducing a series of notable improvements. One of the main highlights in this update is the expanded aircraft recognition system.  A wide range of new aircraft icons has been added, including the B-17, B-24, B-25, and B-29, alongside more modern aircraft, like the Bombardier Global 7500, Embraer E2 series, and Cirrus SR22. Military jets, like the F-104 Starfighter, Kfir, and T-38 Talon, also feature in the list, reflecting the ever-growing variety of aircraft flown by Volanta users. Helicopter pilots will also appreciate a fix to flight playback and charting, which now correctly displays low-speed manoeuvres that were previously missing. Beyond visuals, several quality-of-life fixes have been introduced. V1.13.3 has refined how Volanta handles plugins, reducing the risk of crashes in FSX and Prepar3D. The long-standing issue of the map taking too long to zoom in and out has also been addressed, resulting in quicker and smoother transitions.  Additionally, the SimConnect installation prompt has been removed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 users, since it is no longer required, with the latest plugin system. The update can be downloaded now and will be applied automatically upon opening Volanta. New users can find the program here. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. ToLiss Simulation Software has recently released their A320ceo add-on for X-Plane 11 and 12, adding the legendary A320-214 and A320-232 to their ever-growing roster of Airbus aircraft.Â  Unlike their previous releases, their A320ceo requires the A320neo to work, hence the lower price tag of $30. It brings two engine variants (CFM56-5B4 and IAE V2527-A5), wingtip fences and sharklets, accurate performance figures, a detailed 3D model for each engine type, a specific TSS sound set for each engine variant, and much more. Furthermore, the fuel system configuration was adapted to accurately replicate how the CEO handles fuel, with the electrical center tanks feeding the engines and switching automatically with engine selection. The weight envelope was also altered to conform to the older engines. Displays and flight management systems were also changed to match the older airframe. Itâs available on the X-Plane.Org Store for $29.95, requiring 268 MB of free hard disk space and a valid copy of their previously released A320neo.

It was built in the early 1930s to replace Invercargillâs former main airport, an aerodrome on a farm 10 kilometers away from the city. Due to their location choice, on a former tidal estuary lake, they had to drain all the water and stabilize the land before construction, which took three years. It was not until 1939 that it was finally ready to get traffic. World War 2 was already in progress during its completion, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force used it as an auxiliary field, still secondary to the aerodrome on a farm, as that one could actually handle heavier patrol bombers.Â  The first scheduled service, a Union Airways flight to Dunedin on a Lockheed 10 Electra, occurred only in 1944. â Twelve years later, the runway underwent a massive upgrade: finally, pavement was installed, and a hefty temporary terminal was built to better handle the passenger traffic.Â  â The runway was expanded over the decades that followed to accommodate larger aircraft and thus âkeep up with the times.â It peaked at its current 2210 meters. The first âpermanentâ terminal facility was built in 1963, with a lozenge-shaped roof, fully glazed airside walls, and two levels. A small jetway was added in 1988 to make things easier for the passengers, but it was removed in 2012. In the 2010s, a new passenger terminal was built from the ground up. The previous terminal was over 50 years old and severely compromised by seismic issues that occasionally hit the area. The administration figured that demolishing everything and starting over anew would be more logical. As of late 2025, Air New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch) and Stewart Island Flights (Oban) are the only airlines serving the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, over 35 custom objects, enhanced night lighting, PBR textures, custom ground markings, and much more. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $11.01, requiring at least 2.53 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. EDIT: As of 26.09.2025, the Beta build 3 has been recalled due to the issues experienced by Mac users. â Laminar Research has published a new beta build with weather radar improvements, bug fixes and improvements for the default aircraft, implementation of new debug tools for developers, and the fix for the users who experienced black boxes in the sky. Currently, there are two known issues: the update to Beta build 3 for users on macOS will fail unless the X-Plane.app file is deleted beforehand, and the weather radar output may be inaccurate for some 3rd party aircraft. â This build brought in many improvements and fixes, with some of them being the improved TrackIR movement, a new debug tool for capturing graphic data, fixed synchronising between sim and UTC time, improved colors of the VFR map and the Synthetic Vision, improved crash handling on systems using Windows, and many more. For the aircraft side of the update, the close-range weather radar detection has been significantly improved, as in the previous versions, the radar could miss the clouds due to the width of the beam. The rest of the improvements are for the Beechcraft Baron 58, where the fuel tank selector could cause some levers to get stuck, Boeing 737-800, where the wind condensation particles have been corrected, and lastly, the PROG page on the Cessna Citation X on the second FMS is now fixed, and the destination airport is displayed there as well. â The full change log is as follows: â General Aircraft General Beechcraft Baron 58 Boeing B737-800 Cessna Citation X Graphics â The Beta 3 is available for download for all users who have chosen the public beta. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!Â  â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a development update justifying their recent "silence" of sorts. An illness got in the way, and part of the team was on vacation, but that doesn't mean their work stopped: there's progress on the 777 lineup update, new information on the 737NG, and two previews from the upcoming 747 Classic! Their 777 lineup has been updated to build 121 on MSFS 2020/2024 (Marketplace), with 2024 taking a bit longer to be on build 121 due to an issue with texture streaming. On the other hand, the website customers are already on build 130. A new build will be released sometime next week, with the Marketplace version to follow soon after the intake process. The aforementioned texture issue still hasn't been fully mitigated, but PMDG and Microsoft are investigating the cause to try and come up with a solution. It manifests by randomly displaying odd textures on the wings and "other places." The only way to fix it is by going on the tablet and replacing the tires. They are not exactly sure why it fixes it, but they suspect it's because MSFS 2024 does not like the methods they use to reflect tire wear. The long-awaited sound update for the 777 fleet is in its final approval stages. It will completely rebuild and upgrade the airplane's sound environment based on hundreds of new recordings, code magic, and audio engineering wizardry. Although some roadblocks were encountered during the development process, they have been overcome, and they think the wait will be worth it. â Furthermore, in Randazzo's words, the new sound environment "sounds like it sounds on the airplane", "not simply serving as a mimic the high-frequency-distorted sound you hear in most YouTube videos". "If you have an opportunity to sit on the flight deck in flight, the audio environment is far more broad-spectrum than what can be picked up by the average consumer grade electret microphones, so we not only had to make a heavy investment in studio grade equipment, we had to then make the investment in studio grade processing and expertise in order to ensure the sound sampling and mixing was done in such a way that you will experience the entire broad spectrum of sound as if you were sitting in the airplane". â The 737NG's port for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has progressed into fitness and cleanup, and they are already looking at the calendar to plan a release date, albeit cautiously, as they are still not entirely happy with the product's state. â Once the 737-800 goes into final testing, they will shift their attention to the -700, then the -900, and -600, respectively. â They have also shared an image of the upcoming 747 Classic, which still isn't quite ready for previewing. For the time being, they have shifted their development focus to the 737NG for 2024. They have also not clarified whether it's the 747-100 or the 747-400, leaving it to the audience to find out. PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Nimbus Simulation Studios Teases 707's Flight Deck</title>
    <updated>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Nimbus Simulation Studios has recently shared a few screenshots of the cockpit progress on their Boeing 707 for X-Plane, which was first announced during last yearâs FSExpo. The new previews showcase the cockpit work under different lighting conditions, highlighting their intricate attention to overall detail, with wear and tear to boot, as youâd expect from such an old airplane. The 707 was Boeingâs first jet, directly contributing to the history of modern travel by being the first commercially successful jet. It truly inaugurated the so-called âjet age,â transforming long-distance air travel into a fast, reliable, and somewhat affordable means of mass travel.Â  Its revolutionary design was centered around speed and efficiency, cruising higher than most airliners at the time, avoiding turbulence and reducing drag, often cutting transatlantic travel times in half. Its impact was much more than just the noticeably faster speed; it wasÂ also cultural and economic, forever changing the landscape of airline travel. Thereâs still no release date or pricing information, but Threshold will keep you updated! If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
