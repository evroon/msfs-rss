    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flightbeam Studios has recently previewed their work on San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator and launched theirÂ Discord serverÂ for future product previews, support, and more. San Francisco International is the second-busiest airport in California, with a yearly average of 57 million passengers, only behind Los Angeles International.Â  Itâs a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. According to Flightbeam, the upcoming scenery will be their most detailed work yet, sitting high above their previous releases regarding visual complexity, quality, and performance, hence the âCaptainâs Editionâ title.Â  â Itâs said to be inching closer to completion, with a potential release happening before summer if things go according to plan. The pictures shared cover International Terminal A and its surroundings, and further previews will be shared closer to release. All the terminals have been revamped from the inside out. Thereâs no price or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft/sim-wings have recently updated their rendition of Adolfo SuÃ¡rez Madrid-Barajas Airport (LEMD) for X-Plane 12, bringing SAM improvements, airport functionality tweaks, and more. It was constructed in 1927 and opened in 1931, with commercial operations starting two years after the official inauguration. It was initially unpaved, and the paving process only began in 1940.Â  The National Terminal, now T2, was inaugurated in 1954 after mere months of construction. It was considered a first-class international airport in 1957. Terminal 1 was constructed in the 1970s during the air travel boom, which was a direct consequence of the advent of the Boeing 747. It reached 4 million passengers yearly during the period that led to its construction. In the 1990s, the terminals saw further expansion, which happened again with the construction of Terminal 4 in 2004, significantly increasing its passenger handling capabilities. With a yearly average of 61 million passengers, itâs the busiest airport in Spain and the 5th busiest in Europe. Itâs a hub for Air Europa, Iberia, Iberia Express, Iberia Regional, Plus Ultra LÃ­neas AÃ©reas, and World 2 Fly, and an operating base for Iberojet, Ryanair, and Wamos Air. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, AeromÃ©xico, Air Arabia, Air China, Air France, Air Transat, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Finnair, Korean, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Chile, LATAM PerÃº, Lufthansa, Transavia, Turkish, United Airlines, and WizzAir also serve it.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Burning Blue Design has recently previewed their work on Bembridge Airport (EGHJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an unlicensed aerodrome in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, England.  It opened in 1920 on land owned by Bembridge Farm, becoming a licensed aerodrome one year later.  Airline services started in 1934 with Spartan Airlines, and other airlines followed suit, such as Portsmouth Southsea, Isle of Wight Aviation, and Channel Air Ferries). It ended abruptly shortly after the start of World War 2, as the airport was closed and ditches obstructed the runway to make it unusable. It reopened as soon as the war ended, but airline services never resumed. It continued as a general aviation airfield and eventually became a manufacturing ground for Britten Norman in the 60s, where they built many Islanders and Trislanders. They are still in production today, with over 1200 produced so far. â One of Britten Norman's subsidiaries, Aero Composites Ltd, began assembling Cirrus aircraft (SR20 and SR22s) in 2005. â Thereâs no information on pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Project MAX has recently released their rendition of Husein Sastranegara International Airport (WICC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Bandung in Indonesia, with a yearly average of 4.3 million passengers. It was built during the Dutch colonial period and was a low-traffic airport for many decades, with less than 30 flights a day. The situation changed in the 2010s, leading to a surge that its infrastructure was not quite ready for, as the old terminal could only handle up to 750,000 passengers yearly. It eventually led to the construction of a new terminal. â Itâs being gradually replaced by Kertajati International Airport, the second largest airport by area in the country, inaugurated in 2018. It has been getting most of the domestic traffic that once landed in Sastranegara. The airport has already been partially retired as of late 2023, with turboprop flights from Susi Air being the sole exception.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR textures, a 3D detailed full interior, custom ground poly, detailed landside, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $9.63, requiring at least 3.38 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Today has been an exciting day in the world of flight simulation! Weâre one day into the amazing event that is FSWeekend in Lelystad, The Netherlands, and weâve prepared a roundup of all the dayâs news if you didnât catch it yesterday.  â Todayâs event was kicked off by Magnus Axholt, CEO of Navigraph, and his announcements on some new features coming to their Charts software, chiefly among them being able to now annotate charts, as well as Operational Flight Plans from SimBrief. Along with being able to highlight taxi routes, users are also able to create boxes around important items such as minimum speed restrictions. Along with changes to Navigraph Charts, Axholt mentioned a new project dubbed âNavigraph Academyâ set to debut this fall. According to him, the project âbasically stems from the fact that you guys have been missing an instruction manual."  Moving on to the next announcements, which came from Thompson on the X-Plane team, discussing all that is to come with the upcoming X-Plane 12.1.0. First, he went over how graphics will be improved in the update, with fixes to CPU performance, clouds, and highly requested fixes for the Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) in the sim. Along with those, there are new particle effects, improving immersion in-sim. Thompson went on to describe improvements for the weather system, including a brand new real weather server, as well as improvements to METAR parsing, and fixes for odd weather data. Phillip from the team discussed improvements to avionics, including the G1000, STEC S-360 Autopilot, and new ice/de-ice visual effects. Also discussed during the presentation was additions for Pro users of X-Plane.  After X-Plane came a video showcase from the team at FlyByWire, which featured their highly anticipated A380X, and showed progress on visuals, systems, sounds, and even a fully modeled cabin. You can watch the showcase video on YouTube here and see the amazing work theyâve done! Next up was Mobiflight, hosted by creator Sebastian (who I had the pleasure meeting at FSExpo â23). The main emphasis during their presentation was the power that the flight simulation community has, and how amazing it can be through the power of open source software. Mobiflight also announced that they are getting a new UI and frontend framework, which will include lots of design improvements as well as a dark mode. Last, but certainly not least was a lesser known company amongst the mainstream flight sim community, ProSim. ProSim is mainly known for their aircraft software that can be used to integrate into home built full flight simulators, and is very popular in that market, but has recently gained traction due to the fact that the Fenix A320 was based off of ProSimâs A320. They are also known for their commercial solutions through their fixed base trainers. In their presentation, ProSim renewed their focus on home cockpit building, by launching a new brand, called HomeSim. They have split their consumer business and commercial business, where the consumer side is now HomeSim, and the commercial side is still ProSim. They have a substantial development roadmap for home users, and have rededicated themselves to home simulation. And with that closes a very packed day at Europeâs largest flight simulation convention! But, thereâs still another day, so stay tuned to Threshold for the roundup for Day 2, and a sneak peak behind the scenes on what goes on at FSWeekend!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlyByWire has recently shared a video of their upcoming Airbus A380 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, demonstrating a full flight - albeit with cuts and acceleration - from Toulouse to Munich. â The 10-minute video is their most revealing A380 footage yet, and it shows a bit of the cockpit modeling, aircraft system power-up from cold and dark, engine startup, take-off sounds, and more: â The developers emphasize it's still in development, and the video does not represent the final stage of the product. Designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large aircraft market, the A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner, seating up to 853 passengers in a single-class configuration or 525 passengers in a typical three-class configuration. There's no information on the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently broken the silence about which variant is releasing first, along with a full-blown 45-minute live stream answering many questions regarding upcoming features, potential limitations, and more. â There was a lot of mystery surrounding the first 777 variant to release, with a considerable part of the community supposing it would be the 777-200ER for the longest time. It had not been revealed when PMDG shared the first images a few months ago, but Robert Randazzo finally broke the silence during the live stream, revealing it would be the 777-300ER to release first. With the variant out of the way, many people also wanted to know about the presence of RF legs and CPDLC, to which Randazzo responded with a âmaybeâ for the former, and the latter will initially see a basic implementation with Hoppie, which will then get updated in the future with an in-house solution, as Hoppie is said to ânot be a realistic representation of how it works in real life,â according to Robert.  While they still donât have an exact date for the release, Robert expects it to come out within two months if things go according to plan, and it just might have a basic weather radar - albeit sim limited - included, unlike their 737 Lineup.  PMDG has also uploaded a 2-minute showcase video of the upcoming product, with shots of the interior, exterior, and passenger cabin, emphasizing their modern modeling techniques.  Thereâs no release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. It was another exciting day packed with amazing things at FSWeekend in Lelystad, Netherlands! Todayâs presentations were announcements, panels, and weâve prepared a roundup of all the news on the final day of FSWeekend 2024.The first presentation was from Papa Hotel, who showcased his rendition of Lelystad Airport, which is the location of FSWeekend, in Microsoft Flight Simulator! In the presentation, he confirmed features such as custom 3D objects, custom orthophotos, interior modeling for the terminal, and more! He also said that he is committed to upgrading the airport with new features in the future. After the panel by FSElite, which included names such as Andreas from cruiselevel.de, Jamie, more commonly known as LondonController, Jordan from FSElite, and Thresholdâs own Magnus Lorvik, there was a presentation by Mike from FlightSimCoach. Mike discussed aspects of FlightSimCoach, which is a service that helps flight simmers get a more in-depth introduction into flight simming, as well as offers one-on-one instruction with an instructor that can help with anything and is bespoke to a simmerâs needs. Keeping on ahead there was a presentation by ToLiss, being a retrospective on the past decade of ToLiss products. He went into more depth on the ToLiss history, and highlights of the products theyâve released. Also in their presentation was a hint at what aircraft they were working on next, but unfortunately, the only thing that was mentioned was that it was going to be another Airbus aircraft. And with that concludes FSWeekend 2024, and all the exciting announcements and showcases that happened today! Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold, because we have some exciting behind-the-scenes content at FSWeekend weâre excited to share, and weâre so excited on what amazing things will happen at next yearâs FSWeekend!</summary>
