    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG has recently issued an update to their 777 lineup (777-300R and 777F) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The update cleans up a few items that required attention after the 777F release and addresses issues on the 777-300R caused by code changes to accommodate the 777F.Â  Update v2.00.0060 eliminates the ghost cargo door advisory and its associated TOCWS trigger on the 777-300ER and adds numerous model cleanups, logic fixes, and more. The changelog follows below: â They have also published new information on the status of their Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 port: they are now able to run code and debugging in MSFS 2024 after a recent update, but the memory allocation error from 2020 appears to be present in 2024 as well â despite PMDG reporting it in the past â, bringing the development effort to a halt as C++ WASM projects seem to rely heavily on advanced memory allocation techniques used by modern C++ compilers. That means they cannot run, build, or test code properly within MSFS 2024. The 737 family will soon receive an update to address the issue with the Universal Flight Tablet not loading properly. Thereâs no exact prediction of when it will be available for Marketplace users, but it should be coming soon for PMDG.com customers. PMDGâs aircraft lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TorqueSim has released their long-awaited CItationJet 525 for X-Plane 12. After more than six years of development, one of the most popular business jets is finally here! Produced to replace the ageing Citation I and IIs, the Cessna CitationJet 525 had its first flight in April 1991 and has since been developed into Model 525A, 525B, and 525C. Over 2000 CitationJets have been produced, making them the most produced business jets. Capable of cruising up to altitudes of 41,000ft and equipped with two Williams R-R FJ44-1A turbofan engines, this T-tail jet can fly at Mach 0.65 for around 1560 nautical miles ( ~2880km). The TorqueSimâs rendition of CitationJet 525 features an authentic flight model with custom airfoils, custom soundpack, high-resolution textures, custom-developed electrical, hydraulic, fuel, and pneumatic systems, custom Honeywell avionics. It also supports RealityXP GNS/GTN, as well as the upcoming TDS Sim GTNXi. The TakeCommand! CitationJet 525 is available for purchase at the X-Aviation store for $84.95.Â  It is compatible with X-Plane 12 only and can be used on MacOS 12+ (at least Monterey), Windows 10+, and Linux (support is provided only for Ubuntu 24.02 LTS). The recommended specifications for it are CPU with 4+ Cores (3 GHz+), 16+ GB RAM, and NVIDIA or AMD GPU with 4+ GB VRAM. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <title>TDS Sim Software Updates GTNXi Pro for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2024-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tds113"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TDS Sim Software has recently released an update to their GTNXi Pro Suite, adding compatibility with Microsoftâs latest flight simulator. While their original plan was to make it compatible as soon as MSFS 2024 was out, a WASM gauge issue made it impossible for a few weeks. However, Asobo has finally managed to address the show stopperâto an extentâas another update blocked the display. A community developer found a workaround that will suffice until an official fix is out. The development team is excited about the new platform and all its possibilities, gauging what they can benefit from and the work it would entail. They have coded the new executable to detect the exact MSFS platform (whether 2020 or 2024) and correctly share it between platforms. Each MSFS version has its own different WASM gauge. â Owners of the base GTNXi package will have to upgrade in order to get compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Refer to this link for further information on acquiring the upgrade. â The GTNXi Pro is available on their website for $68.20, whereas the pro upgrade from the standard package retails for $26.20.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. ToLiss has just released V1.7 of its A321. This update introduces numerous new features and bug fixes.Â  â This update - the first in over a year, mostly follows the pattern established by V1.10 of the A319, which was released just a few days ago. However the A321 also gets its fair share of exclusive updates. â Â V1.7 includes enhanced hydraulic, MCDU, ECAM, and FMGS systems for greater realism, alongside new visual details, failure modes, and operational improvements like quick engine starts and improved terrain rendering.Â  â The A321XLR also receives a set of exclusive changes, like fuel capabilities that more accurately match the real-life aircraft, the implementation of the RCT fuel panel, and passenger limits that reflect the number of over-wing exits. Here is the complete list of changes provided by ToLiss:New features:- ISCS in EFB- Hydraulic improvement package:	. Added simulation of trapped hydraulic fluid in asymmetric actuators such as landing gear or spoiler actuators.	. Fixed the PTU overheat when ENG1 is failed.- MCDU improvement package:	. CLR command is now indented in scratchpad as in real life	. DIR TO page prefills the RADIAL IN on the DIR TO page as required	. FPLN Page Destination EFOB turns amber, if below minimum required.- ECAM improvement package:	. Overspeed warning now triggers based on actual flap/slat position and not lever position (PFD barber pole is still lever position driven as in real life.)	. Removed duplication of system titles if the same system shows multiple subsequent rows of ECAM messages.	. Weight display logic for SD: Prior to engine start, the dashes are now cyan. Weights now only show after engine start, like in real life.	. Status page improvement: Approach procedures for hydraulic faults	. Rework of the ECAM messages for electrical bus failures to represent a newer FWC standard- FMGS improvement package:	. Added possibility to use Airport ICAO codes as waypoints	. Bug fixes for the path computation leading to an overall much stabler path computation in complex procedures.	. Empty flight plan shows as PPOS / Discon rather than just "End of flpn" and can be built up from there.	. VIA selection is now automatic, if there is exactly one VIA that matches the selected FINAL and STAR.	. Constraints of first waypoint in STAR are not dropped anymore.	- Added cross track error display on ground prior to departure- New failure modes:	. Slow and rapid decompression	. THS jam.	. Cargo smoke, including latched closure of the isolation valves	. Added high lift failures, including loss of SFCC channels and slats/flaps lock	. Windshears with correct REAC W/S detection and indication.- Visual improvement package:	. Added AoA Vanes to fuselage model	. Fixed the tiller textures	. Animated the flap lever guard	. Correct the eye reference ball colors and location	. Fixed text overlaps on the overhead panel- Added new Circuit breakers (for high lift, air conditioning packs, ...) bringing the total to 242- Added pitch influence to the RADALT value, so that the RADALT decreases when you pitch up (like IRL)- Added limitation with filtering to the maximum number of waypoints shown on ND when WPT overlay selected.- Quick starts for engine and APU are now available on the Joystick/Actions tab.- Mapped flight number to x-plane dataref "sim/cockpit2/radios/actuators/flight_id" for third party plugin interfacing.- Improved Master Warning flashing frequency.- Terrain on ND drawing around the airport is now inhibited for areas of same elevation as the airport.- If you select a livery with 2 OWE pairs, the maximum number of passengers will increase to 160.- Added selected heading value on ND, if in ARC mode the heading bug is not visible.- A321neo package specific improvements:	. Adapted fuel capacities for the XLR to the real life values that are now available	. Implemented the new RCT fuel panel for the A321XLR Bug fixes: - Fixed issue with the interaction between the CLR button and the status page - Fixed issue with status page overflow. - The emergency generator now consumes hydraulic fluid. - The magnetic variation model now updates for the current year. - Fixed FMA alignment of armed modes and issue with empty boxes - Extended the permissible value range for FCU speed window to 399kts and Mach 0.99 like in real life - Extended the permissible value range for FCU altitude window to 49000ft like in real life - ISI startup correction: QNH is also visible during ISI startup; moved QNH to right location. - Removed CHG CODE field for other phases than PREFLIGHT or DONE. - Improved string termination on MCDU string datarefs. - Fixed an issue with SID route in alternate plan on first alternate plan programming. - Fixed an issue with waypoints preceded by a discon where the outgoing leg is of the CI/CD/CR/CA or VI/VR/VD type. - Fixed FMA indication for managed descent on profile with significantly too slow speed. - Fixed behaviour of the FCU HDG managed dot when a managed mode (NAV, LOC, APPR) is armed. - Fixed shape of the ADF2 needle on the ND. - Removed GS indication on ND, when the associated ADIRU is OFF or invalid. - Made the deceleration when descending through the SPD LIM altitude smoother. - Fixed issue with the beta target leading to excessive rudder deflection and spoiler extension on the wrong side. - Corrected the color of the RAM Air Inlet indication when open in flight. - Disabled autobrake if 2 or more SECs are lost. - Fixed a bug that could cause sending many requests to the Hoppie network in a short period of time. - Miscellaneous other bug fixes The update is available now for all owners of the ToLiss A321. A clean install from the store is recommended due to the migration of the updater repository. â Stay tuned to Threshold for news, reviews, and more.

    <title>X-Crafts Publishes ERJ Family Development Update for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2024-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/erjx12"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/676228db8f59052d3782d60f_erj1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts recently published a blog post outlining their plans for a future update to its ERJ Family, which will add many new features and be fully compatible with Laminar Researchâs latest flight simulation platform.Â  â The development update begins with a quick explanation of why the ERJs have not seen many updates since their focus shifted to the E-Jets, which required further attention due to their heavy reliance on automation and increased system complexity.Â  â When X-Plane 12 came out, X-Crafts intended on making it compatible as soon as possible, but they quickly realized it was not going to be as straightforward of a job as they thought it would due to how different the new simulator was in some ways, rendering the airplane unusable without workarounds. â Addressing the issues would require a lot of extra work and effort, which made creating a compatibility patch rather unfeasible and illogical, given they could rebuild it instead and make a major upgrade out of it rather than just a mere patch.Â  â They have been working on the ERJ Family v2 upgrade for a while now and feel ready to share how things are progressing and bring a close look at the new features that will accompany the new version. â An industry specialist created the flight model from scratch, fully optimized for X-Plane 12. Real ERJ pilots are currently testing it to ensure it is as accurate as possible within the simulation. Unlike the X-Plane 11 version, where default X-Plane systems drove hydraulics, fuel, and anti-ice systems, v2 will bring custom-made systems and a new and more accurate FADEC system to control the Thrust Rating. The pop-up screensâfamiliar to E-Jets customersâwere also implemented in V2. There is an openable PFD, MFD, and EICAS that can be freely moved around the screen or placed on another display. Autopilot settings can be controlled directly from the pop-up PFD by scrolling while hovering over the values. The nav map has also seen a substantial visual upgrade, with a brand-new, high-resolution display, including the PLAN mode.Â  They are also working on implementing the Electronic Flight Bag from the E-Jets into the ERJs, which will allow users to control ground objects, doors, performance calculations, weight and balance, and more. A secret set of featuresâwhich remains unmentionedâis also in the works. The update will also improve the sounds, taking full advantage of the new audio technologies embedded within X-Plane 12. â Due to the amount of work involved and all the new features, the ERJ v2 Update will not be a free upgrade. They intend to charge a $20 fee for v1 owners, and the base price for new customers will also suffer a slight increase.Â  â There is no release date yet, but X-Crafts plans on releasing the Lineage 1000 first, which is scheduled to come out before the end of February if everything goes according to plan.Â  â Please refer to the original blog post for further information on the update.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds recently published a short statement on the future of their upcoming Airbus A350 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Due to stability and reliability issues with Microsoft's newest flight simulator, they decided to make it also compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. First announced in late 2023, iniBuilds' original intent was to make it available for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 first and later provide a port to MSFS 2024, but a lot has changed since then, and at one point, they decided to make it MSFS 2024 only.Â  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has not lived up to many people's expectations, leading to an increasing number of people begging iniBuilds to consider making it compatible with the olderâand significantly more stableâsimulator.Â  â While the asset streaming idea looked pretty good and promising on paper, its practicality had proven quite questionable after a disastrous release day and the following couple of weeks before things got under control. From not being able to get into the simulator at all to aircraft sounds vanishing halfway through the flight, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 managed to become one of the worst-rated triple-A titles on Steam.Â  â Considering that, iniBuilds decided to release the A350 for both simulators in one purchase, with two distinct development cycles, allowing people the freedom of choice. â They have also briefly hinted at revealing more information about the upcoming product on Saturday (21/12), almost one year after its official announcement.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TropicalSim has recently released their rendition of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, initially with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom night lighting, animated jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $18.88, requiring at least 243.58 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

The airport serves the Orkney Islands in Scotland and has a yearly average of 143,000 passengers. Built in 1940 as RAF Grimsetter to defend the Scapa Flow Naval base, taking its name from the homonymous farm it was built over.Â  Three years later, the Royal Navy took over and renamed it Royal Naval Air Station Grimsetter. Control was passed over to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in 1948 and handed over to an administration company in the mid-1980s, ultimately ending its military roles. Nowadays, Kirkwall Airport serves as a vital connection between the Orkney Islands and the mainland, operating services to Aberdeen, Belfast City, Dundee, Ebay, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness, London Heathrow, Manchester, North Ronaldsay, Papa Westray, Sanday, Stronsay, Sumburgh, and Westray through Loganair, which is the only airline serving the airport as of 2024. The airport is home to the Sustainable Aviation Test Environment (SATE), the United Kingdomâs first low-carbon aviation test center. It is helping to pave aviationâs future one test flight at a time. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D-modeled terminal, custom landside buildings and hangars, custom ground textures, custom runway textures, a custom interior, and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $11.99 and is currently compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Once the in-sim marketplace is launched, an MSFS 2024 exclusive version will be available. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Just Flight recently published a new development update on the upcoming Airbus A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, showcasing the night lighting logic in the flight deck and addressing its compatibility with MSFS 2024. The developers are finishing work on the animation and lighting logic for nearly two thousand switches, dials, and annunciator lights. This process required coding each element, verifying its operability within the simulator, and tweaking the animations or artwork further when needed.Â  Their systems coders have made great progress over the last 18 months. They will soon be able to âbring the aircraft to lifeâ as the cockpit artwork and animations are ready. They look forward to sharing systems previews early next year. The exterior has not been previewed yet because it is undergoing work on refining its overall geometry, adding extra details such as panels, lines, wiring around the landing gear, and a detailed cargo hold, to name a few. The modeling has recently reached completion, and texturing is now underway, with previews to come in 2025. Similarly to their upcoming Fokkers, core development will remain on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for now while they wait for greater stability. The commitment to support both simulators remains.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently launched the trailer for their upcoming Airbus A350 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, along with a comprehensive development update listing some of its features and shedding light on a potential release date. As previously covered, iniBuilds decided to make it compatible with 2020 due to stability and reliability issues with Microsoftâs new flight simulator, thus investing in two development cycles under a single purchase and allowing the freedom of platform choice. âWe will do our very best to have parity in feature sets between both versions of the aircraft, but please note this will not be possible all the way, and more details will be shared close to release,â they conclude. The feature list promises a detailed 3D cabin with a cabin announcement system, a comprehensive flight attendant panel, custom terrain radar, detailed systems simulation, Navigraph integration with SimBrief import feature, a situation manager, ABEAM &amp; Offset simulation, intricate 3D model and texturing, GPS jamming, multiple failures, Brake-to-Vacate, and structural vibrations.Â  They claim to have worked very hard to provide a top-tier simulation of its electrical parts and systems, with a full-fledged electrical bus simulation, dynamic load computation, distinct battery options (NiCad or Lithium, with varying capacities and amperage), and noise-optimized N1 settings for NADP procedures. iniBuilds will be commencing their usual Aircraft showcase series on YouTube within the next few weeks, walking people through some of these new features. While the A350 was originally set to be released in 2024, iniBuilds has made the difficult decision to postpone the release to Q1 2025 to warrant a âfantastic product on launch.â Both variants will be available on day one, and the XLR will come at a later date.
