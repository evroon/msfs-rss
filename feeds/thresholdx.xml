    <title>FlightSim Studio Provides Q3 Update, Updates 727</title>
    <updated>2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fssq3u"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68d569c8447617c919325db2_Q3-header.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlightSim Studio has provided a roundup of its current projects following the summer break, released 727 Super27 expansion, as well as given some updates, on the newly confirmed 727-100, the E-Jets closed beta, and native MSFS 2024 Tecnam updates. The 727 Super27 expansion has now released, and FSS also provided two posts that detailed visual refreshes and system work. The headline change is an EFIS fit, paired with a new autopilot, that adds VNAV modes and RNAV approaches.Â The 727 has now also been updated to v1.1.3. Documentation is already available, and creators should have access to preview content. As a reminder, Super27 is an expansion that requires a base 727 installation (passenger or freighter).Â  The EFIS and new autopilot operate with the GNS-XLS and remain optional, while the digital VSI with TCAS can be used in the base 727 when Super27 is installed. Alongside that, the studio has formally begun work on the 727-100. The plan covers a dedicated freighter and a dedicated passenger variant; convertible models are not currently planned. A Super27 treatment for the -100 is under consideration for later, but the immediate priority is to bring the variant fully into the sim first. On the E-Jets side, closed beta testing continues, with a focus on LNAV/VNAV, performance prediction, and autopilot behaviour. Issues highlighted by testers include waypoint skipping on the lateral path, intermittent drops on the vertical profile, autothrottle oscillation during step climbs, take-off Flight Director sequencing, and unreliable fuel and time estimates.Â  Two departure-routing bugs have been resolved internally, though other items remain. The team is also integrating Navigraph data into the new MCDU to replace problematic stock data. This work has slowed some bug-fixing, but is expected to reduce nav-data-related reports once complete. VNAV logic already follows generated vertical profiles, handles step climbs and pre-TOD descents, and can fly RNAV approaches; however, VNAV is not enabled in the current closed beta, as stability and path generation are being improved first. Finally, the Tecnam P2006T and P2012 are being prepared as native Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 releases. The P2006T is set to receive an enhanced 3D model, new textures, improved flight dynamics, a new FS24 EFB, and a native walkaround.Â  The P2012 is due for improved sounds, an FS24 EFB, and a native walkaround. Flight Sim Studios has not provided release windows for these aircraft, noting that timelines depend on parallel work elsewhere. For the full details, you can read the official update on FSS' website. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has, in conjunction with World Update 20, released Local Legend 22, bringing Japanâs post-war NAMC YS-11 airliner to both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024.Â  Developed by the Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation in the late 1950s, the YS-11 first flew in 1962 and entered service three years later. A straightforward, robust design, low wing, pressurised cabin, and tricycle gear helped it find work with civil and military operators worldwide.Â  Power comes from a pair of Rolls-Royce Dart Mk. 542-12K turboprops, driving four-blade, constant-speed propellers, giving the YS-11 plenty of short-field capability. In the simulator, the YS-11 is offered in two variants, Passenger and VIP Charter, and comes with a set of period-appropriate liveries. Performance figures presented with the release include a service ceiling of 23,000 feet, a maximum range of 1,485 miles, and a typical cruise speed of nearly 294 mph.Â  The YS-11 also boasts impressive take-off and landing distances of 3,642 feet and 2,165 feet, respectively. For the full read, you can find Microsoft's blog post here. Local Legend 22 is now available via the in-sim marketplace for $19.99, with rental options including a seven-day pass for $9.99, a three-day pass for $6.99, and a one-day free trial.

    <title>Aeroplane Heaven Teases de Havilland Mosquito for Microsoft Flight Simulator</title>
    <updated>2025-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ahdhlm"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68d6b53c08c6063f0da56c19_553754326_1472243147602593_3308607875618847901_n.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aeroplane Heaven has recently taken to Facebook to tease yet another project, providing a set of work-in-progress screenshots that reveal the legendary de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito. This reveal lands days after the developer officially announced its B-25J Mitchell, meaning Aeroplane Heaven now has two iconic World War II bombers for MSFS in the pipeline.Â  Nicknamed the âWooden Wonderâ (or simply the âMossieâ), the Mosquito was one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the Second World War. It had a plywood construction, twin Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, and was a fast, agile, and adaptable aircraft, serving as a bomber, night fighter, pathfinder, and reconnaissance platform.  It even carried out some of the warâs most daring precision strikes, like the famous Amiens Prison raid. The early screenshots showcase a nicely detailed cockpit, complete with scuffed paint, weathered fittings, and authentic wartime instrumentation.Â  Itâs a world of chunky levers, green-painted panels, and exposed wiring, showing off what Aeroplane Heaven is well known for. Externals also make an appearance, giving us a peek at the landing gear and fuselage lines, that defined the Mosquitoâs unmistakable profile. Aeroplane Heaven has kept specifics close to its chest. We donât yet know which Mosquito variants will be modelled, or what the release timeline will be. From the look of things, the 3D modelling phase is well underway, but the larger details are still under wraps.  Weâll keep you updated on the Aeroplane Heaven Mosquito!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has just released their Wolfâs Fang Runway (AT98) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing an Antarctic blue-ice strip to the sim as free scenery. The airfield, used seasonally by operations in Queen Maud Land, is represented with a bespoke texture set for ice and snow, custom environment-specific lighting, and detailed camp assets, vehicles, and static aircraft. The layout reflects the current site, and iniBuilds has done some level-of-detail work to ensure satisfying performance. Wolfâs Fang is modelled as a long, true-course runway, cut into glacial terrain, notable for its distinctive surface and remote setting.  Accompanying the release is a brief navigation guide, covering route suggestions from Cape Town, basic procedures, and waypoint tips, for sim briefings and FMS entry. The feature list of Wolf's Fang follows below: iniBuildsâ Wolfâs Fang Runway scenery is available for free on the iniBuilds store. The download weighs in at roughly 230 MB, with an installed size of about 498 MB. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Orbx has recently released version 1.13.3 of their Volanta plug-in, a free, flight-tracking application for desktop and mobile, introducing a series of notable improvements. One of the main highlights in this update is the expanded aircraft recognition system.  A wide range of new aircraft icons has been added, including the B-17, B-24, B-25, and B-29, alongside more modern aircraft, like the Bombardier Global 7500, Embraer E2 series, and Cirrus SR22. Military jets, like the F-104 Starfighter, Kfir, and T-38 Talon, also feature in the list, reflecting the ever-growing variety of aircraft flown by Volanta users. Helicopter pilots will also appreciate a fix to flight playback and charting, which now correctly displays low-speed manoeuvres that were previously missing. Beyond visuals, several quality-of-life fixes have been introduced. V1.13.3 has refined how Volanta handles plugins, reducing the risk of crashes in FSX and Prepar3D. The long-standing issue of the map taking too long to zoom in and out has also been addressed, resulting in quicker and smoother transitions.  Additionally, the SimConnect installation prompt has been removed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 users, since it is no longer required, with the latest plugin system. The update can be downloaded now and will be applied automatically upon opening Volanta. New users can find the program here. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. ToLiss Simulation Software has recently released their A320ceo add-on for X-Plane 11 and 12, adding the legendary A320-214 and A320-232 to their ever-growing roster of Airbus aircraft.Â  Unlike their previous releases, their A320ceo requires the A320neo to work, hence the lower price tag of $30. It brings two engine variants (CFM56-5B4 and IAE V2527-A5), wingtip fences and sharklets, accurate performance figures, a detailed 3D model for each engine type, a specific TSS sound set for each engine variant, and much more. Furthermore, the fuel system configuration was adapted to accurately replicate how the CEO handles fuel, with the electrical center tanks feeding the engines and switching automatically with engine selection. The weight envelope was also altered to conform to the older engines. Displays and flight management systems were also changed to match the older airframe. Itâs available on the X-Plane.Org Store for $29.95, requiring 268 MB of free hard disk space and a valid copy of their previously released A320neo.

    <title>Astralis Studios Releases Invercargill Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/astracargill"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68d7841c81d25ea4510381c5_cargill1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Astralis Studios has recently released their rendition of Invercargill Airport (NZNV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Invercargill, New Zealand, and has a yearly average of 270,920 passengers. It was built in the early 1930s to replace Invercargillâs former main airport, an aerodrome on a farm 10 kilometers away from the city. Due to their location choice, on a former tidal estuary lake, they had to drain all the water and stabilize the land before construction, which took three years. It was not until 1939 that it was finally ready to get traffic. World War 2 was already in progress during its completion, and the Royal New Zealand Air Force used it as an auxiliary field, still secondary to the aerodrome on a farm, as that one could actually handle heavier patrol bombers.Â  The first scheduled service, a Union Airways flight to Dunedin on a Lockheed 10 Electra, occurred only in 1944. â Twelve years later, the runway underwent a massive upgrade: finally, pavement was installed, and a hefty temporary terminal was built to better handle the passenger traffic.Â  â The runway was expanded over the decades that followed to accommodate larger aircraft and thus âkeep up with the times.â It peaked at its current 2210 meters. The first âpermanentâ terminal facility was built in 1963, with a lozenge-shaped roof, fully glazed airside walls, and two levels. A small jetway was added in 1988 to make things easier for the passengers, but it was removed in 2012. In the 2010s, a new passenger terminal was built from the ground up. The previous terminal was over 50 years old and severely compromised by seismic issues that occasionally hit the area. The administration figured that demolishing everything and starting over anew would be more logical. As of late 2025, Air New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch) and Stewart Island Flights (Oban) are the only airlines serving the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, over 35 custom objects, enhanced night lighting, PBR textures, custom ground markings, and much more. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $11.01, requiring at least 2.53 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. EDIT: As of 26.09.2025, the Beta build 3 has been recalled due to the issues experienced by Mac users. â Laminar Research has published a new beta build with weather radar improvements, bug fixes and improvements for the default aircraft, implementation of new debug tools for developers, and the fix for the users who experienced black boxes in the sky. Currently, there are two known issues: the update to Beta build 3 for users on macOS will fail unless the X-Plane.app file is deleted beforehand, and the weather radar output may be inaccurate for some 3rd party aircraft. â This build brought in many improvements and fixes, with some of them being the improved TrackIR movement, a new debug tool for capturing graphic data, fixed synchronising between sim and UTC time, improved colors of the VFR map and the Synthetic Vision, improved crash handling on systems using Windows, and many more. For the aircraft side of the update, the close-range weather radar detection has been significantly improved, as in the previous versions, the radar could miss the clouds due to the width of the beam. The rest of the improvements are for the Beechcraft Baron 58, where the fuel tank selector could cause some levers to get stuck, Boeing 737-800, where the wind condensation particles have been corrected, and lastly, the PROG page on the Cessna Citation X on the second FMS is now fixed, and the destination airport is displayed there as well. â The full change log is as follows: â General Aircraft General Beechcraft Baron 58 Boeing B737-800 Cessna Citation X Graphics â The Beta 3 is available for download for all users who have chosen the public beta. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!Â  â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdgdevupd279"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6731bf52e0c3783d31cd6eb3_1250410_20240628201837_1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a development update justifying their recent "silence" of sorts. An illness got in the way, and part of the team was on vacation, but that doesn't mean their work stopped: there's progress on the 777 lineup update, new information on the 737NG, and two previews from the upcoming 747 Classic! Their 777 lineup has been updated to build 121 on MSFS 2020/2024 (Marketplace), with 2024 taking a bit longer to be on build 121 due to an issue with texture streaming. On the other hand, the website customers are already on build 130. A new build will be released sometime next week, with the Marketplace version to follow soon after the intake process. The aforementioned texture issue still hasn't been fully mitigated, but PMDG and Microsoft are investigating the cause to try and come up with a solution. It manifests by randomly displaying odd textures on the wings and "other places." The only way to fix it is by going on the tablet and replacing the tires. They are not exactly sure why it fixes it, but they suspect it's because MSFS 2024 does not like the methods they use to reflect tire wear. The long-awaited sound update for the 777 fleet is in its final approval stages. It will completely rebuild and upgrade the airplane's sound environment based on hundreds of new recordings, code magic, and audio engineering wizardry. Although some roadblocks were encountered during the development process, they have been overcome, and they think the wait will be worth it. â Furthermore, in Randazzo's words, the new sound environment "sounds like it sounds on the airplane", "not simply serving as a mimic the high-frequency-distorted sound you hear in most YouTube videos". "If you have an opportunity to sit on the flight deck in flight, the audio environment is far more broad-spectrum than what can be picked up by the average consumer grade electret microphones, so we not only had to make a heavy investment in studio grade equipment, we had to then make the investment in studio grade processing and expertise in order to ensure the sound sampling and mixing was done in such a way that you will experience the entire broad spectrum of sound as if you were sitting in the airplane". â The 737NG's port for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has progressed into fitness and cleanup, and they are already looking at the calendar to plan a release date, albeit cautiously, as they are still not entirely happy with the product's state. â Once the 737-800 goes into final testing, they will shift their attention to the -700, then the -900, and -600, respectively. â They have also shared an image of the upcoming 747 Classic, which still isn't quite ready for previewing. For the time being, they have shifted their development focus to the 737NG for 2024. They have also not clarified whether it's the 747-100 or the 747-400, leaving it to the audience to find out. PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Nimbus Simulation Studios has recently shared a few screenshots of the cockpit progress on their Boeing 707 for X-Plane, which was first announced during last yearâs FSExpo. The new previews showcase the cockpit work under different lighting conditions, highlighting their intricate attention to overall detail, with wear and tear to boot, as youâd expect from such an old airplane. The 707 was Boeingâs first jet, directly contributing to the history of modern travel by being the first commercially successful jet. It truly inaugurated the so-called âjet age,â transforming long-distance air travel into a fast, reliable, and somewhat affordable means of mass travel.Â  Its revolutionary design was centered around speed and efficiency, cruising higher than most airliners at the time, avoiding turbulence and reducing drag, often cutting transatlantic travel times in half. Its impact was much more than just the noticeably faster speed; it wasÂ also cultural and economic, forever changing the landscape of airline travel. Thereâs still no release date or pricing information, but Threshold will keep you updated! If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UHI Products has recently released its CJ-6A Primary Trainer for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, via the Just Flight store.Â Modelled on an early variant of the Chinese Nanchang CJ-6A, the two-seat trainer arrives with more than 15 liveries, dual-seat operation from front and rear cockpits, and support for aerobatic manoeuvres, including smoke effects. The package features a compressed-air engine start, working emergency cold-air system, gravity-fed tanks, attitude-indicator drift, and a left-turning constant-speed, variable-pitch propeller.Â  Cockpit labels can be toggled between Chinese and English, gauges can switch between metric and imperial, and an optional modern GPS (via the free PMS530 plugin) is supported.Â  Flight dynamics are based on manual data, with feedback from real-world pilots, while sounds were recorded from the aircraft itself. Other touches include ground differential braking, multi-level LOD for smoother online flying, and manuals in Chinese and English.Â  The CJ-6A is available now through JustFlight, for $18.99, with a 436MB download.

    <updated>2025-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. RowsFire has just announced that pre-orders for their A105 radio and frequency panel and A107 overhead panel are now live. Both Airbus-styled panels are estimated to ship between October 15th and 30th. Additionally, the team has provided a development update, which includes the announcement of a Boeing 737 overhead panel.  The A105 features a combined RMP (Radio Management Panel) and ATC (Air Traffic Control) panel, equipped with backlit buttons and toggle switches. This panel is compatible with the Airbus A320 family by Fenix, FBW, and iniBuilds in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The price of the A105 is $249.99, and it can be pre-ordered from their website. Customers can use the discount code rowsfire15N to receive a 15% discount on their pre-order.  The A107 has been upgraded to version 3 (V3), incorporating several improvements over the previous model. The upgraded A107 V3 features stronger buttons to address issues found in the earlier version. Additionally, the panel thickness has been increased, the toggle switches have been enhanced, and the USB port has been relocated to the back of the unit instead of the side. There are also various other improvements.  â Similar to the A105, the A107 V3 is compatible with the Airbus A320 family, specifically from Fenix, FBW, and iniBuilds, in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The new A107 is priced at $379.99 and is available for pre-order from their website. Customers can receive a 15% discount on their pre-order by using the discount code rowsfire15N.  It's worth noticing that customers who have purchased a previous version of the A107 from RowsFire and whose orders have not yet shipped are eligible for a free upgrade to the new V3 model. If you wish to upgrade to V3 instead of receiving the V2, you must inform customer service within three days. Please be aware that if you choose to upgrade to V3, shipping will be delayed until after October 15th.  â If you do not notify the team of your desire to upgrade within three days, you will receive the V2 model. Additionally, all customers who own the A107 V1 or V2, whether purchased directly from RowsFire or elsewhere, are eligible for a 20% discount on the new V3. To take advantage of this discount, the team asks customers to contact their customer service.  Along with the announcement that both panels are now available for pre-order, the team has also shared a development update on their ongoing plans. The A101, A103, A105, A107, and A109 models have all been upgraded to V3. This version introduces light synchronization, which aligns the hardware lighting with the aircraft lighting in the simulator. Additionally, V3 includes various other enhancements for each model, which are all listed in the full development update.  â Furthermore, the A108 is set to receive upgrades by October 15th, including improvements to the shell, screen, and functionality of the panel.  â Lastly, the team has announced that they are developing an overhead panel for the Boeing 737, which is expected to be completed in November. The design drawings for the new overhead panel have already been finalized. You can find the complete development update and details about all hardware upgrades here.  â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!  â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>VATSIM Cancels Cross the Pond Eastbound 2025</title>
    <updated>2025-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ctpcnc"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68dc2ffd1c3ff29e54647d52_M9SDSfIVHfX2wzq1Xmq2CpwSH2vgCJZr6CWEJtb7.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The online network VATSIM has today put forward a statement, confirming that the upcoming Cross the Pond (CTP) Eastbound event, scheduled for later this year, will officially not proceed, after consultation with partners. In their statement, the Cross the Pond Planning Team explained that Cross the Pond has continued to grow in scale with every edition, prompting the need for a âtemporary breakâ, to review how the event is managed.Â  The team said the goal is to ensure a better overall experience for everyone involved, including vACC and division staff, pilots, and, importantly, controllers. They added that the intention is to return in spring 2026, with a new edition of the event, with further details expected in the first quarter of that year. â The full statement reads: â "Dear Members, With every event, Cross the Pond grows more and more. After some discussions with our partners, weâve collectively decided to take a temporary break to determine the future of CTP, keeping everyoneâs enjoyment of the event front and center. We hope to be back next spring with a new edition of the event. We will take this opportunity to revise some aspects of how we create and manage the event, to lead to a better experience for all those involved - Division/vACC staff, pilots, and very importantly, ATCOs. We understand that this might cause some frustration, and believe us, this was not an easy decision. We hope to count on your support and understanding. More news will follow in the 1st quarter of 2026, where we aim to host the next edition of Cross the Pond! Thank you, On behalf of the Planning Team" Cross the Pond, often referred to simply as CTP, is one of VATSIMâs flagship events. Held twice a year, it offers thousands of virtual pilots the chance to fly across the Atlantic, with full, end-to-end Air Traffic Control coverage. Slots for participation are typically booked in advance and remain in high demand, making it one of the most popular gatherings on the network. For now, attention turns to 2026, when the Planning Team hopes to bring the event back in refreshed form. Threshold will keep you updated.
