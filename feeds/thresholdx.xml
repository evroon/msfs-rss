    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued a new update to their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing extensive bug fixes, performance improvements, and a refined audio experience. Update v1.1.7 has a strong focus on performance improvements, and they are pleased to report significant gains across the board. Their team has worked very hard to optimize every area of the airplane, which will hugely benefit those on weaker hardware. Based on customer feedback, they have developed a new performance-friendly cabin as the default, eliminating the need to disable the cabin entirely for performance. However, the option to turn the cabin off will remain available for those who wish to do so. â They have also decided to sunset the cabin packs from 1.1.7 onward, focusing their efforts on further optimizing the core product experience. iniBuilds also clarifies that custom cabin livery textures are still fully supported across all cabin variants. â Furthermore, they have reduced the quality of some textures on the A350 while ensuring they do not impact the visual fidelity in any way. â Their 3D model also underwent a slight optimization process, significantly reducing the node count by several thousand, resulting in a positive improvement to main thread performance. The wingflex system was also changed to a more optimized method, reducing the number of âbonesâ by 50%. â The optimization work also extended to the LODs, which, although not heavily contributing to performance gains, helped somewhat, making the transitions smoother.  â The average framerate has improved by 19.6% on their test system, and the 1% lows went up by 58%.  â The sound department has also seen improvements, as seen below: The complete changelog follows below: âV1.1.7SYSTEMS âï¸FIXED FLS clearance logic after NEW DEST insertion.FIXED VNAV wind component direction/sign conventions and path geometry.FIXED VNAV path agreement with VSD (constraint interpolation &amp; smoothing).FIXED PERF DES speed schedule and VDEV stability.FIXED Vertical Display showing ETP/time markers.FIXED DIR TO logic, temporary flight plan creation, and waypoint ordering.FIXED Wind page ordering (highest FL to lowest).FIXED Manual leg sequencing, waypoint deletion behaviour, and scratchpad validation.FIXED Custom waypoint handling (PBD / LAT-LON / 3â4 letter stored waypoints).FIXED Incorrect destination field elevation and altitude reference usage.FIXED Departure SID parsing and selection reliability.FIXED Arrival/Approach selection and correct propagation to SEC F-PLN.FIXED RNP AR guidance stability, VDEV behaviour, and RF-leg tracking.FIXED LS and FLS course sourcing for PFD annunciation.FIXED Constraint displays relative to TL/TA logic.FIXED Step climb ETA and calculation logic when offsets or conditional waypoints are present.FIXED Oceanic Clearance entry workflow and CPDLC handling logic.FIXED Offset waypoint creation (-XX nm) and abeam logic.FIXED ACTIVE/SEC common-leg behaviour.FIXED Cruise MACH, REC MAX, and ISA deviation integration.FIXED Step climb trigger logic and TO waypoint formatting.FIXED High-elevation airport logic for TO/DES predictions.FIXED GS mini computation using correct wind component.FIXED APP DES behaviour and pitch/thrust blending.FIXED AP V/S mode pitch-command smoothing.FIXED Pitch trim initialisation for airborne starts.FIXED V/S display behaviour during preflight.FIXED EO acceleration altitude logic.FIXED VAPP/VLS consistency and wind additives.FIXED VFE and VMAX CONF1 accuracy.FIXED Aileron neutral feedback indication.FIXED FLS/LOC/VOR approach symbology across PFD/ND.FIXED BLEED 1+2, PACK 1+2, and X-BLEED ECAM logic.FIXED WING ANTI-ICE ECAM behaviour.FIXED TR1/2/EMER voltage modelling.FIXED HYD and F/CTL SD page alignment and indication precision.FIXED Fuel quantity resolution (10kg).FIXED IR/ADR switching behaviour and OFF annunciation.FIXED ADIRS pushbutton logic.FIXED Cargo temperature regulation indication.FIXED Brake temperature arc placement.FIXED Beacon/chocks logic for ground ops.FIXED Door/cabin readiness indications.FIXED Engine/pitot cover detection logic.FIXED Loadsheet formatting and message record handling.FIXED Turnaround/MCDU reset behaviour.FIXED BTV stop margin entry behaviour.FIXED LDG MEMO timing alignment.ADDED Local terrain database download capability.ADDED RMP frequency uplink via ACARS.ADDED ACARS timeout logic.FIXED RAD NAV auto-cleaning and frequency handling.FIXED HUD symbology stability (FPV, track bug, LS scale).FIXED PFD track/altitude indications around 360Â° transitions.FIXED ISIS text and menu alignment.FIXED ND symbology for terrain, RF legs, and approach overlays.FIXED FO-side ND airport data call.FIXED SEC PLAN ND rendering.FIXED OIS layout and format improvements.FIXED L/G Gravity Ext erroneous message ART ð¨FIXED AP disconnect and priority pushbutton animations.FIXED Reverser lever animations and detent accuracy.FIXED Vertical tail aerodynamic behaviour with no hydraulics.FIXED Spoiler droop representation on SD and external model.FIXED Wing/lighting interaction (flash issue).FIXED Jetway 2L behaviour (A340 parity).ADDED Full cabin light-off option on FA Panel.FIXED Setting "Night Mode" on FA Panel correctly dims lightscape OISð»FIXED Door control logic from EFB ground menu.FIXED Enroute map rendering, refresh logic, and layer stability.FIXED Multi-page SID/STAR/APP chart rendering.FIXED Takeoff config workflow when cabin not ready.FIXED Terrain download status reporting.FIXED ZFW entry and performance workflow in OIS.FIXED Landing performance FT/M conversion.FIXED EFB map refresh &amp; state management.ADDED âReset to Recommended Levelsâ for volume settings.ADDED Permanent HUD cover toggle in equipment page.ADDED Chart viewer UI improvements (text scaling, accessibility).

    <title>Aerosoft and ToLiss Showcase Flying the A340-600 ProÂ </title>
    <updated>2025-11-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/atfsws"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6921a5774976dcbd6fcb7071_-RgS560d3fA-HD.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has released a brand-new preview of its upcoming Airbus A340-600 Pro for MSFS 2024, offering a full-length walkthrough of four scenarios that were first shown publicly at last weekâs FS Conference. It gives the clearest look yet at the aircraftâs systems, failure logic, and in-flight behaviour. In the new video, Aerosoft community manager Rafi and ToLiss developer Torsten guide viewers through each scenario, crafted specifically to highlight various system features, rather than simply A to B (which we will see more of later!). You can watch the full scenario showcase here.  The first scenario is a âstraightforwardâ landing into Quito, as straightforward as landings into Quito can be.Â  Throughout the video, Torsten offers commentary on how each system reacts, why specific procedures exist, and what real-world Airbus pilots would experience in each situation. The aircraft is set up for an RNP final at around 9,000 ft, using the built-in autosave/load system. Here, there are no failures at the show, though the thin air and higher ground speed at Quito still make for a challenge.Â  The second run repeats the approach, but sabotages the air data system midway, leaving the aircraft in alternate law, and forcing you to fly pitch and power using the backup speed tape. From there, the demo moves to Frankfurt for a dual hydraulic failure, with both green and blue systems out, autopilot gone, and even the slats freeze after the second hydraulic loss. We also get to see the gravity-drop landing gear extension. The final scenario recreates a V1 engine failure in Frankfurt, with knock-on failures such as a green-system leak, slat asymmetry, an abnormal bleed configuration, and an eroded braking option. While Aerosoft emphasises that the aircraft is still in development, this video marks the first time the public has seen the A340-600 Pro in action. The team avoids showing the external model for now; however, external previews are ânot far awayâ. There will also be a full-flight livestream featuring real A340 pilots down the line. They also previously stated the A340-600 Pro is still on track for release before Christmas, though a short slip into January remains possible if a late blocker appears.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Xometry have recently released their rendition of West Virginia International Yeager Airport (KCRW) for both X-Plane 11 and 12. Located in Kanawha County, it serves the capital of West Virginia, Charleston (not to be confused with Charleston, South Carolina, known for the assembly facility for B787), with more than 400,000 passenger operations per year. Opened in 1947, the Kanawha Airport served as a replacement for the old Charleston airport - Wertz Field, as it had to be closed due to the factory that had blocked the approach paths. American Airlines was the first airline to start operating flights from the new airport. Three years later, the airport received its first terminal.Â  In 1985, the airport was renamed to West Virginia International Yeager Airport, in honour of the legendary Chuck Yeager, the first man in the history of mankind to break the sound barrier, while flying a Bell X-1. The Yeager Airport is currently served by four airlines: American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Connection and United Express, to 6 destinations, along with a seasonal route to Myrtle Beach, operated by Breeze. The Xometryâs rendition of West Virginia International Yeager Airport features high-resolution ground textures, detailed buildings, custom high-res mesh, SAM jetways and marshallers, custom night lighting, realistic vegetation and a high-resolution colour-corrected Ortho4XP patch. The scenery is available on the iniBuilds store for roughly $14.39, and requires at least 2.27GB of free disk space.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Manchester Airport (EGCC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving Greater Manchester, in the United Kingdom, with a yearly average of 30.9 million passengers, making it the third-busiest airport in the country. It officially opened as Ringway Airport in 1938, and later, during World War II, it became RAF Ringway, serving as a Royal Air Force base that trained parachutists and provided grounds for military aircraft production. Post-war, it reverted to its civilian duties, rapidly becoming Britainâs second-busiest airport after London Heathrow. The buildings that once belonged to the RAF were replaced by a passenger terminal in 1962, featuring a modern departures hall (the first covered passenger piers in Europe). The airport underwent significant expansion during the 1980s and 1990s to meet the ever-growing passenger demands. By 1987, the airport was handling a million passengers per month. Terminal A, now part of Terminal 3, was inaugurated in 1989, followed by Terminal 2 in 1992, along with the opening of the Manchester Airport Station. The main terminal became Terminal 1. In the late 1990s, the second runway was constructed, causing massive protests in Cheshire, where people had to be relocated to make space for the runway. In 2019, they inaugurated the first phase of Terminal 2âs expansion project, and the second phase was completed two years later, in 2021. Itâs a hub for Aer Lingus UK, easyJet, Jet2, TUI Airways, Ryanair, and Virgin Atlantic. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air France, Air Transat, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia Express, Icelandair, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Royal Jordanian, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. Their next addition to the British lineup was meticulously crafted, utilising thousands of reference photos and textures. They also gained insight into their daily operations, future expansion plans, and design updates, which helped them further increase overall accuracy. The scenery features hand-made ground textures, a true-to-life landside recreation, dynamic airport lighting, custom jetways, over 180 hand-crafted models, a full HD ground poly, an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimisation, and much more. â Itâs available in the iniBuilds Store for roughly $23.56, requiring at least 4.74 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations has just published a new development update, confirming that its A320neo expansion will not arrive before the end of 2025, as the team has shifted attention to the current A320 lineup for now. After what Fenix describes as intense, very direct feedback from users and support tickets, three problem areas have been pushed to the front of the queue, these being VNAV, state saving, and an ageing ECAM framework. As for the VNAV, this will see a full rewrite. Fenix openly admits that the existing system sits on very old, generalised code, which has led to oddities in vertical path building, deceleration placement, and performance figures.  The new VNAV is built from the ground up, including more accurate handling of pressurisation segments and decel points, and the team says it has captured behaviour it previously only saw in the real aircraft or full-fidelity level-D simulators. Underneath that, a brand-new ECAM infrastructure is replacing the legacy system. Both the revised VNAV and the new ECAM framework have entered limited internal testing, with small groups of subject matter experts focusing on each system, before a wider beta follows.  Fenix says the NEOs are already in a position to move into testing once the VNAV and ECAM update has been released to existing customers. Alongside this, work on proper state saving continues in the background. The team plans to share dedicated media showcasing the new VNAV and ECAM closer to release, and only then will the spotlight fully swing back to the A320neo and the experimental features being lined up for its eventual debut.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has shared a batch of night-time previews from its upcoming rendition of Harstad / Narvik Airport (ENEV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  The new screenshots focus on the atmosphere after sunset, with apron and terminal lighting, detailed tower work, and updated building textures all on display.Â  Located in Evenes, Harstad/Narvik serves as an important gateway to northern Norway and the wider HÃ¥logaland region, making it a nice base for both domestic journeys and adventures further out towards Lofoten and VesterÃ¥len. MM Simulations signs off by saying that more previews are on the way, so those keen to add another Norwegian stop to their route network should not have to wait too long before seeing more of ENEV in action.

    <title>Orbx Releases Perth International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their rendition of Perth International Airport (YPPH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the 4th busiest airport in Australia, with a yearly average of 17 million passengers. The airport was built in the late 1930s to replace the cityâs former main airport, Maylands Aerodrome. Maylands had become too small for the larger airplanes of that era and was impossible to expand. With the advent of World War 2, the Royal Australian Air Force redesigned the new facility for military purposes. Civil operations started mid-war in 1944 with Qantas Empire Airways and Australian National Airways. This happened despite protests from military authorities, who were against it due to it âunderminingâ their defense and camouflage needs. The government ignored the protest and authorized the airlines to move from Maylands to the new airport. They wanted to operate larger aircraft, which were too large for the older airport. Perth was granted its International status in 1952, despite not yet having a proper passenger terminal. They were using an adapted hangar as the passenger terminal was still under construction. The jet age made Perth a strategic stopover for flights to Asia. This increased its passenger figures dramatically, forcing the administration to expand the infrastructure as demand grew. A new terminal opened in the early 1960s to replace the adapted hangar terminals, finally bringing the airport into the modern era. In the 1980s, the project for a new international terminal was approved, featuring a modern design that would facilitate easy expansion whenever necessary. Construction work began in 1984, and the facility was officially opened in 1986. The international terminal was expanded from 2003 to 2004. The project added extra floor space, introduced new duty-free facilities, and modernized the infrastructure. In 2012, the airport was rated as the worst in Australia. This changed with the modernization and expansion that occurred in the years that followed. It eventually became the best airport in Australia six years later. As of 2025, they are expanding Terminal 2 again. The goal is to double its passenger handling capabilities by 2027. â Itâs a hub for Qantas, Virgin Australia, and Virgin Australia Regional, and an operating base for Alliance Airlines, Jetstar, National Jet Express, Network Aviation, and Skippers Aviation. AirAsia, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Batik Air, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways International, and VietJet also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout reflecting the latest changes, a highly detailed skybridge and T1 International Terminal, PBR materials, Dynamic Lighting, custom ground poly, custom jetways, high-resolution aerial imagery, and much more. â Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $17.59 (2020/2024), requiring at least 11.95 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has launched Navigraph Academy, a new free training platform for those seeking more resources to sim like a real-world pilot.Â  Front and centre is the Virtual Private Pilot Licence (VPPL) course, which lets you practise core general aviation procedures. The VPPL course includes video lessons, written theory, quizzes, and in-sim exercises, mirroring the structure of real-world PPL training.Â  Students work through topics such as basic aerodynamics, aircraft handling, navigation, airspace, and standard operating procedures, with each lesson including a practical flying component that immediately applies the knowledge in the simulator. According to Navigraph, the material has been developed with real pilots and instructors to keep the syllabus as close as reasonably possible to actual aviation training while remaining accessible to newcomers.Â  Progress is tracked within the platform, and those who complete the full programme receive a digital certificate to mark their achievement. Navigraph Academy is free to use and does not require an active Navigraph subscription; only a standard account is required. The VPPL is the first of several planned courses, with instrument flying and instrument approaches already teased as âcoming soonâ.Â  With the trailer now live and the first course available, Navigraph Academy looks to become an interesting starting point for new simmers, and a more structured training path for people looking to take things a step up.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Airplane Simulation Company has released its C-130J Super Hercules for DCS World, landing alongside the latest simulator update, version 2.9.22.17790. The module brings a deeply simulated, fully interactive C130. The Hercules arrives with a clickable cockpit, modern digital avionics, and a detailed simulation of the AE 2100D3 turboprop engines. A standout feature is the first-person loadmaster mode, letting you walk through the cargo bay, move around the exterior, and handle loads directly. The aircraft supports vehicle transport, airdrops, and even deployment of the enormous GBU-43/B MOAB, all enhanced by DCSâs new dynamic cargo system. Thanks to the update, the C-130J can also act as a mobile logistics hub, spawning Forward Arming and Refuelling Points from delivered cargo. Multi-crew is supported at launch, with pilot and co-pilot roles available, and a third station planned.  Airplane Simulation Company notes a few early-access limitations, including occasional visual glitches when unloading cargo, restrictions on re-loading previously unloaded vehicles, and an in-game manual that misbehaves in VR. The C-130J is available now for $63.99 via Steam, the Eagle Dynamics e-shop, and the Airplane Simulation Company website. Read the full DCS 2.9.22.17790 changelog here.
