    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries recently released their rendition of Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport (RPVA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. This airport serves Tacloban, the Philippines, and has a yearly average of 1.5 million passengers.Â  It was constructed as an airstrip for the US Air Force during World War 2, housing multiple bombing and fighter units throughout the conflict. It was converted into a commercial airport soon after and renamed from San Jose Airstrip to Tacloban National Airport. In late 2013, Typhoon Haiyan demolished the terminal and the control tower, leading to a reconstruction effort. A few days later, it reopened for turboprop aircraft, and by November 14, it could already welcome narrowbody jets such as the 738 and A320. The passenger terminal was expanded in 2017 to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, adding 1,100 square meters of floor area and an additional 275 seats in the pre-departure area, raising the total to 635. This sufficed for at least three simultaneous flights, whereas it could just barely handle two beforehand. Approval for the construction of a new terminal, capable of handling up to 1,670 passengers/hour, was granted in 2020. Construction started that same year and is halfway complete as of early 2023.Â  Itâs served by Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, PAL Express, and Philippines AirAsia. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom POIs, custom ground clutter, custom interiors, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.66, requiring at least 3.76GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>SoFly Announces Cardiff Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/flycwl"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66c7c6035adad60c48e07851_cardiff1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SoFly has recently announced the development and imminent release of Cardiff Airport (EGFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Cardiff, Wales, with a yearly average of 859,000 passengers. It was built as RAF Rhoose in 1941 and started operations a year later as the home grounds for the No 53 Operational Training Unit, which trained future Spitfire pilots for World War 2 and beyond. It was abandoned right after World War 2, only to be brought back to life in the early 1950s after the Minister of Civil Aviation brought up his wish to build an airport in South Wales. After much deliberation between the options, they decided to repair the abandoned RAF station and invest whatever was necessary to convert it into a commercial airport.Â  It was then inaugurated in 1952 as Rhoose Airport, with Aer Lingus being the first to start scheduled commercial service routes from their base in Dublin. Flights from the former main airport in Cardiff (Pengam Moors) were transferred to Rhoose in 1954, featuring flights to France, Belfast, and Cork.Â  In early 1965, the airport was transferred to Glamorgan City Council, which started a five-year development plan that included a new tower, a new terminal building, and a runway extension. The runway was further extended in the 1980s, marking its renaming as Cardiff-Wales Airport. The new extension attracted British Airwaysâ attention, as it could accommodate their Boeing 747s for maintenance.Â  â A 100 million pound development strategy was announced in 2005, aiming to extend and upgrade the terminal. It was anticipated that it would attract up to 5 million passengers within a decade, a 150% increase. Only 3 million pounds were actually spent, half funded by the Welsh Government, refurbishing and redeveloping the passenger terminal. Further upgrade work was carried out in 2017 at an extra 4 million pounds. â Aer Lingus, KLM, Loganair, Play, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Vueling serve it. â The upcoming scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with an animated hangar, full GSX compatibility, highly detailed custom models, custom ground texturing, custom terminal interiors, and more. â Itâs set to release next Thursday (the 29th) for roughly $15.71.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The X-Plane developer software âWorldEditorâ has just received an update. The main portion of the update is set to bring new features for X-Plane scenery developers. The software is a key tool for devs, allowing them to modify and customize existing airports in X-Plane. One of the features to come with this update is the ability to now offer dual jetways. Each jetway can be assigned to a door on the aircraft, reducing the chances of jetways clipping through each other. In addition, devs can also export polygonal data (with exclusions) to third-party software to help design custom scenery elevations. Other minor updates include Shape Entities, Non-integer spacing for strings and tiles shader effects on ground textures. Finally, the team have added the feature to manually create 3D terrain. This feature was showcased on the iconic island of Saba and St Barths in the caribbean. Both airports have terrain around them that causes difficultly when departing or arriving. With all these new features, we can hope to see new sceneries being created for X-Plane, with high quality and exciting new options.Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news, and remember to join our Discord Server!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After receiving the trailer in April this year, Areosoft has been hard at work developing their rendition of Frankfurt Main Airport. The team have released the second part of their interview to discuss progress. The video showcases the terminal interiors, airfield night lighting and some features that lie to the south of the airport. The video started with the team discussing how important being in touch with the real airport has been in development. The connection allowed them to stay accurate throughout the ground layout. The interior of an addon scenery plays an important role in improving the level of detail. 3D interiors create a depth of feel when pilots are parked on the stand. The team mentioned that it will not be 100% accurate as that level of detail will require an increase in resources and a reduction in performance. In addition, time spent modelling interiors could be spent on other finer details of the airport. The next portion of the video discusses night lighting. One challenge they faced was the vast amount of lights to be placed around the airport and the location they have. An interesting fact is that Frankfurt features over 40 different floodlights. Each has been modelled differently by the team. An approach into Runway 25R, will showcase the vast terminal and perimeter lighting system. The final portion of the video showcased some of the features you can find to the south of the airport. The largest apron is used by the Lufthansa Technical team, with most of the maintenance on Lufthansas fleet taking place there. Also, a new general aviation ramp to the southwest of the airport allows the flow of small aircraft operations. As the team close in on development, we will keep a close eye on the progress and make sure to provide the latest news!Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold and join our Discord Server.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Black Square recently released a major update for their TBM 850 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The aircraft has been updated to version 1.3. The new update includes numerous new features and bug fixes. Some of the most notable features in the update include a new tablet interface, added wing flex, improved de-icing visuals, functional weather radar gain, and much more. This new major update has given the aircraft a variety of new features, making it as realistic as possible. The new version also includes numerous bug fixes. Due to the large number of fixes, we have included the complete changelog for the entire update below: â v1.2 - Major Update: Tablet, Exterior Elements &amp; RNAV Autopilot â â New Features: â - NEW TABLET INTERFACE!Â  The same great tablet interface youâve come to enjoy in the Black Square Dukeâs added to the Black Square TBM 850 for free.Â  Configuring options, hot-swapping avionics, payload settings, failure management, from the tablet, with real time visualizers for engines, electrical schematics, and environmental systems. - Improved environmental system accuracy necessary for the tablet visualizer - Exterior elements available via the tablet interface, such as pitot covers with âRemove Before Flightâ flags that blow in the wind, engine covers, wheel chocks, and external power cart. - Improved external power logic for use with the exterior elements options on the tablet. - Wing flex added. - The KNS80 RNAV unit is now capable of controlling the autopilot when no GPS is selected as the primary radio. Â  See the âUsing the KNS-80 RNAV Navigation Systemâ for more information. - Added turbine engine specific failures enabled by the improved engine simulation required for the tablet visualizer, such as compressor stall and surging, P2.5 bleed valve failures, and fuel control unit failures. - Improved deicing visuals on the exterior model.Â  Ice will now break off of the leading edge of the wings only where there are boots, and melt slowly from heated surfaces. - Added SU15 ground handling parameters. - Added functional weather radar gain, controlled by the existing gain knob. - New sections added to the manual on the tablet interface, and control inputs and output variables, extending the manual from 109 to 160 pages.Â  Enjoy! - More equipment temperatures are now calculated for display on the tablet. - Instant Beta on Touchdown option added to the tablet interface.Â  Due to hardware deadbands, Black Square aircraft do not enter propeller beta range after touchdown if the hardware controller was already in the beta range before touchdown.Â  Enabling this option will apply full beta after touchdown to begin slowing the aircraft without the need to âbumpâ your hardware throttle. - Added true Pitch Sync functionality to yoke CWS buttons.Â  Pressing and holding âL:var_PilotCwsâ or binding âK:SYNC_FLIGHT_DIRECTOR_PITCHâ to hardware controls will now allow the aircraft to be maneuvered in pitch while temporarily disabling the autopilot pitch servo. - A persistent tablet option has been added for a static tablet position more comfortable for VR users.Â  The option, titled âVR Tablet Static Positionâ will affix the tablet in a location farther away from the camera, obscuring as little instrumentation as possible. - Improved propeller governor simulation for smoother speed adjustments when testing overspeed limiter, and propeller governor failure is now gradual. - Added a visual detent to the power lever to indicate the flight idle position, as already exists in the Turbine Duke. - Reverse compatibility for VATSIM clients that use âCOM RECIEVE ALLâ for monitoring COM2 audio while transmitting on COM1. - Added emissive light source on the overhead panel lighting posts. - High bleed air flow torque performance reduction simulated. - Added support for 0.5 kHz ADF frequency tuning on the KR 87.Â  A secondary click on the power knob will increment the standby frequency by 0.5 kHz, which will indicate on the display with a small dot to the left of the frequency. - PMS50 WTT Mode has been integrated natively, so no additional packages are required to enjoy the advanced autopilot features available with the PMS50 GTN 750 as the primary source of navigation. - L:Var outputs have been added to all annunciator lights for use with home cockpits. - Added support for WeatherSquare 4000. â â Bug Fixes: â - Finally!Â  There is a solution for the simulatorâs internal rounding error when setting COM frequencies above ~134 MHz.Â  These frequencies will now work properly with 3rd party air traffic control clients in all Black Square Aircraft. - Gas generator vs. density altitude curve corrected for throttle response. - ITT and torque curves adjusted for more correct limiting factors at altitude. - Parasitic drag scaler increased by 1%.Â  High altitude cruising speeds are now correct to the knot based on POH tables. - Dynamic oxygen consumption was erroneously using the outside air pressure, rather than the interior cabin pressure to calculate the biological oxygen requirement.Â  Oxygen consumption in a partially pressurized cabin will now be substantially reduced. - Fixed several oversights in the electrical system pertaining to the essential bus tie. - Fixed annunciator panel test logic so active annunciators do not illuminate when the currently tested circuit does not have power. - Fixed GPS OBS setting with EHSI course knob when using WT GNS and PMS50 GTN. - Engine Trend Monitor shaft horsepower and specific fuel could read slightly high when ram air pressures were low. - RNAV distance would wind up to 999.9nm when a valid DME station was tuned, but the aircraft was on the ground.Â  This was due to interpolation added for autopilot control. - Performance fix for when both PMS50 GTN 750 and TDS GTNxi 750 are installed. - The autopilot would not follow the NAV2 VOR course deviation when selected on the EFS 40 EHSI in some circumstances. - Volume knob momentary push on the TDS GTNxi was producing âKnob Stuckâ warning. - Airframe deicing controller circuit breaker was not tripping with failure. - Torque will no longer diminish at middle throttle settings when using time acceleration. - Overtorque annunciator warning and ETM exceedence redline adjusted. - Annunciator panel test switch inverted to test correct circuit. - Elevator control sensitivity reduced at low dynamic pressures. - VR Pilot Camera position set to match non-VR pilot viewpoint by default. - Fixed secondary GNS 530 com volume knob incorrect animation name. - Fixed COM 1 KX155 volume knob animation that had a lower maximum position than the COM 2 KXX155. - Increased glareshield light emissive intensity. The updated TBM 850 is now available for download and can be purchased at Just Flight for $41.99.Â  â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design has recently shared new previews of their upcoming Warsaw Chopin Airport (EPWA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is now in âshort finalâ (nearing release). The airport serves the Warsaw Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18.5 million passengers, roughly 40% of the countryâs total air passenger traffic. Urban development in the mid-1920s led to air traffic complications around Warsawâs former aerodrome, leading to the need to build a new airport elsewhere. A decade later, a new airport was finally ready to roll, built near the village of Okecie. It featured a ticket office, customs post, police station, newspaper kiosk, restaurant, and viewing terraceâstate-of-the-art infrastructure for early 1930 standards.Â  After the civilian infrastructure was considered ready, they began developing its military potential by constructing a Polish Air Force base, an Institute of Aviation building, an aircraft-building plant, and other military-related structures. In the late 1930s, the airport was equipped with radio navigation equipment to aid pilots during low-visibility conditions.Â  World War 2 wholly destroyed the airport, which happened to be a battleground between the Germans and the Polish Resistance. It was a bombing target from day one and was occupied by the Luftwaffe as soon as Germany took the country over.Â  The Germans built their first concrete runways and taxiways, which remained undamaged until the final days of the war when they were deliberately destroyed to prevent the enemies from using them. After the war, LOT Polish Airlines resumed operations at what used to be the airport, kicking off the reconstruction efforts. In two years, they have built a new terminal, a new control tower, and many aircraft parking stands, making it ready to serve people again. The airportâs terminal was reconstructed between 1964 and 1969 after LOT transferred its maintenance rights to state administration. By 1970, it already hit the one millionth passenger mark. It made them realize that their new terminal was already too small, leading to the construction of a temporary arrival hall, and a pre-war structure was used for domestic operations. â While passenger numbers slightly declined in the early 1980s, the mid-80s and beyond were the opposite, urging the administration to expand the airport further. The expansion plans from the late 1980s only started after the fall of communism in the early 1990s. The new terminal was finally brought to life at the cost of 300 million German marks, using 164 subcontractors and 24 months of work. With a maximum capacity of 3.5 million passengers, it could handle 3.5 more people than the previous terminal, which was more than enough at the time. â A new terminal (North Hall) was built in 2008, featuring a considerably larger footprint. It now handles arrivals for Star Alliance and Oneworld Airlines. â Itâs a hub for LOT Polish Airlines and a focus city for Enter Air, Smartwings Poland, SprintAir, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Air China, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, flydubai, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Qatar Airways, TAP Air Portugal, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. â The scenery will feature custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom ground service equipment, custom landside buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but itâs said to be coming soon.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. After more than 2 years since the last update, Magknight has finally released a major update for the B787. Alongside a couple of minor improvements, the v1.11.0 update brought a major feature: native X-Plane 12 compatibility! In the development update, Magknight has also revealed that another team has contacted them regarding partnering with them and continuing the work on their 787. The future plans include bringing the 787-8 and possibly the 787-10 to XP12, as well as working with the new partners on the 787 and re-doing the whole aircraft from scratch, but at much higher quality, at âhopefully little to no extra cost to our existing usersâ. More info will be revealed in a follow-up post that will be published in the next weeks. The full changelog is as follows: - Repaired EFB W/B- Reactivated Hoppie CPDLC - Reactivated Cabin PA systemÂ  - Introduced X-Plane 12 native compatibility - Minor improvements to performanceÂ  - New âCâ spec Flight ModelÂ  - New control logic - Controls override plugin to fix roll issues.Â  - New Wing model - Interim FBW augmentation mode â Unfortunately, there are a few issues that this update brought, such as inaccurate flaps reading on EICAS, unified GE/RR thrust and performance, functionality on MacOS and Linux isnât verified, and the FMOD error will pop up at launch. The team said that they are working on those issues currently.Â  As always, Threshold will keep you updated on the updates, progress of Magknight 787, and the reveal of the mysterious partner. Until then, stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>
