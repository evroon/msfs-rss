    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Stellar Simulations has recently released their rendition of Bacolod-Silay Airport (RPVB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Bacolod Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers as of 2022. The airportâs site was initially used as an airfield during World War 2 but was abandoned immediately after. Parts of the airfield became a sugarcane plantation. In 1997, a Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) study indicated the need for expansion at four Philippine airports, and Bacolod City Domestic Airport was one of them. It was relatively small for the traffic it was getting, and expansion was impossible, which led to the construction of a brand-new airport. Construction started in 2004, with a 900-day deadline to complete it. During the digging work, the remains of the former WW2 airfield and aircraft wrecks were found. The airportâs construction was considered complete by mid-2007, but there was debate at the time due to a pending runway extension that wasnât complete yet. Commercial operations started in January 2008, replacing the old Bacolod City Domestic Airport.Â  Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, PAL Express, and Philippines AirAsia serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a custom terminal interior, landside buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground clutter, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.69, requiring at least 360.74 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (KPIE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Tampa Bay Area with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers as of 2023. Construction started in 1941 and was acquired shortly after by the United States Army Air Forces to be used as a training base. It was returned to the County after the end of WW2, renamed Pinellas International Airport. Its current name only came to be in 1958 because Pinellas County was not a very attractive name from a tourist standpoint, according to the airport manager (people didnât know where it was). The administration spent $22 million on heavy renovation work in 2009, which included larger gates, jetways, new plumbing, and overall modernization. â Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air, which flies to a wide range of destinations. Sun Country, Minneapolisâ local airline, also flies to St. Pete seasonally. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, LODs for optimization, a simple terminal for optimal performance, custom static models, custom taxiway signage, high-resolution PBR texturing, custom aerial imagery, an official GSX profile, and more. Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $16.99, requiring at least 1.76 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda has just released their rendition of the Pilatus PC-6 Turbo Porter for X-Plane 12. Thanks to its superb STOL performance, and easy-to-maintain design, it is used all around the globe to deliver goods where regular aircraft cannot fly. With its first flight in 1959, the PC-6 Porter was produced at Pilatus Flugzeugwerke in Switzerland. It has been built in both a piston engine version and a turboprop-powered version and was also produced under license by Fairchild Hiller in the USA. After 604 planes were built, during a span of 63 years, Pilatus ended its production in 2022. â Powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-27 turboprop 550 hp engine, the Turbo Porter can cruise at an altitude up to 26.800 feet, with a maximum speed of 125 knots. This gives the plane a range of 1,612 km (870 nm) or 730 km (390 nm) with maximum payload. Due to its amazing STOL capability, the Pilatus PC-6 can take from a runway as short as 195 meters (640ft) and land within a distance of 130 meters (427ft). Thanks to its performance, it holds the record for the highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at 18.865 feet (5,750 m), on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal. â The Thranda PC-6 is a part of the DGS - Dynamic Generation Series, which takes full advantage of X-Planeâs flexibility and in-sim modifications. Some of the included features are: customizing a livery in-sim, changing instrument layouts with different panel configs, switching between different airframe configurations, high-fidelity and precise flight dynamics, and much more. Some of the notable features available in the XP12 version are:Â  The EFB has loads of apps, such as the Aircraft Options App, Weight and Balance app, Instrument Options app, Dynamic Panel app, Static Livery app, DynaFeel app, Log Book app, Checklist app, Ground handling app, Dynamic Livery app, Flight Computer app, and more.

    <title>Pilot Experience Sim Releases Bordeaux-MÃ©rignac Airport V2 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pilot Experience Sim has recently released the second version of their Bordeaux-MÃ©rignac Airport (LFBD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of MÃ©rignac with a yearly average of 7.7 million passengers. It was built in 1910 to host a major Aviation Week event, making it one of the oldest French airports.Â  In the early 1930s, the French Air Force heavily upgraded the airport by constructing many new hangars, surface improvements, and more. A passenger terminal was built in 1935, officially going from an air station to an airport.Â  With World War 2 looming, the government invested more money in transforming Bordeaux into a proper military base, adding two runways, which were completed in 1939 and 1940, respectively. MÃ©rignacâs brand-new runways were quite attractive to the Germans during their invasion of France. The structure was mostly new, and the runways were long and hard, ideal for their operations. They rushed to complete the work on runway two, and soon enough, it became one of their air bases. It was heavily bombed in 1944, and the German soldiers blew up the last remaining buildings before leaving the area.Â  Repairing was carried out right after the war, between 1945 and 1947. Prisoners of war built a terminal, a restaurant, offices, and a control tower. They were meant to be temporary and made of wood, but an actual replacement only happened twelve years later. In 1959, a new terminal was inaugurated, designed by Raymond Mothe. It was expanded several times, and its capacity maxed out at 2 million passengers annually. Further expansion occurred in the early 2000s, bringing its passenger handling capabilities to over 6 million a year. Itâs a focus city for easyJet, Ryanair, and Volotea. Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, 3D people, custom aerial imagery, PBR texturing, custom static aircraft, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.40, requiring at least 4.58 GB of free hard disk space to install.

UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of North Palm Beach County General Airport (F45) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a general aviation airport serving West Palm Beach, in Florida, with a yearly average of 100,000 aircraft operations. Opened in 1994, itâs the countyâs newest airport. It sits right next to the town of Apix, a former rocket testing facility created as part of Project Suntan during the Space Race. Covering an area of 741 hectares, with a huge part of it dedicated to environmental preserves, it has two asphalt runways and a single turf runway. Both asphalt runways are the exact same length (1,311 meters) but have different widths (30 and 23 meters, respectively). The turf one is slightly shorter, at 1,121 meters. The traffic consists mainly of general aviation activities (93%), with the remaining 7% corresponding to air taxi operations. There are 264 aircraft based at the airport in total. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, PBR materials, and more.

With the first regular passenger service starting after WWII, it received service from Ansett Australia, Trans Australian Airlines and Butler Air Transport with DC-3s and DC-4s. In 1958, runways and taxiways got paved, allowing the usage of jet planes such as DC-9, and some bigger prop planes like L-188 Electra. Despite the name change in 1989, Gold Coast Airport still retains its original ICAO and IATA codes: YBCG/OOL.Â  The latest terminal expansion was completed in 2022 and includes more than 19 new parking stands, out of which 4 are equipped with jetbridges. Today, Gold Coast Airport serves 10 airlines flying to 26 different destinations in 3 countries, as well as two more seasonal destinations.Â  The Axonos YBCG features a highly accurate representation of YBCG with a new apron and taxiway, 3D grass, custom HDR night lighting, PBR and HD textures, color-corrected orthophotos and animated marshalls. â This scenery is available for purchase at the OrbxDirect for roughly $19.89 and requires at least 2.32GB of free disk space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Yamagata Airport (RJSC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Yamagata in Japan and has a yearly average of 223,000 passengers. â It was opened by the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War 2 and briefly used by the United States military after the war. Later, it was utilized by the Japanese Self-Defense Force as a training facility.Â  It was turned to civilian control in mid-1964 as a third-class regional airport. Eight years later, the runway was extended to 1,500 meters, leading to a reclassification to Class II in 1979. A new - and final - extension happened in 1981, followed by the construction of a new terminal building in 1984. International charter services started in 1981, taking full advantage of the newly expanded runway. Destinations included Finland, Hungary, New Zealand, and even Mexico. The airport's traffic peak was in 1991, followed by a rapid decline in 1992 due to the inauguration of the Yamagata Shinkansen. While the airport saw almost 500,000 passengers in 1991, the figures were down to 50,000 in 2002.Â  Fuji Dream Airlines (Nagoya, Sapporo), J-Air (Osaka), and Japan Airlines (Tokyo) currently serve it.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom ground-poly, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.86, requiring at least 29.20 MB of free hard disk space to install.
