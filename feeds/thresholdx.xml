    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of a native build of their Accu-Sim Comanche 250 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, including new 2024-only features such as the new EFB apps, dirt accumulation, and more. The upgrade - which will be paid for - will bring native 2024 gauges, a native 2024 EFB with charts and other apps, a full walkaround system using 2024âs standards, dirt accumulation on the exterior, dual PMS/TDS GTN 750/650 configuration, time compression support, and much more. The complete feature list follows below: â - Native 2024 gauges and model with optimized LODs - Native 2024 EFB, allowing the tablet to show charts and other EFB apps - Full walkaround using 2024 system - Dirt accumulation on the exterior, persistent between flights - Dual PMS 750/650 and TDS GTNxi 750/650 GPS configurations for those who want more GPS in the cockpit - Narco NS-800 RNAV configuration for those who want less GPS in the cockpit - STEC ST-901 GPSS module for those who want to follow magenta line on autopilot - Optional Asobo G5 electronic instrument retrofit - Other improvements like time compression support â It will be a $14.99 upgrade for MSFS 2020 owners. â They followed up with a brief Q&amp;A regarding specific aspects of the product, such as livery compatibility and persistence files: Persistence (.dat files): Youâll be able to manually copy your 2020 files into the 2024 version to continue your aircraft history. Instructions will be provided at release; feel free to post on the A2A Forums if you need help. â MSFS2020 liveries: They wonât work as-is, but can be updated to 2024 format (similar to the Aerostar transition). â Aircraft replacement: The Native 2024 Comanche replaces the 2020 version for MSFS2024 users. Your MSFS2020 Comanche will continue working for those who want to keep it. â Performance: Accu-Sim prioritises simulation over visuals. Thereâs only so much detail we can add before impacting performance and we tend to push as much as we can to the core simulation elements over the eye candy. The MSFS2024 Native Comanche uses optimized LODs and as a native model, keeping performance at least on par and often slightly improved over the 2020 version. â Marketplace: Paid optional upgrade. Weâll coordinate with store partners so existing customers receive a discount. Marketplace releases usually take longer; the A2A Store and other vendors go live first. â Thereâs still no information on the release date, but more details will be shared in the coming weeks.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. flyt Simulations has recently released a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024-native version of Comandante Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport (SBJE), offering full compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, and additional features. Funded by a government plan to develop regional aviation in Brazil, construction work began in 2011 and concluded three years later. The inauguration, however, only took place in 2017 after a series of organizational mishaps. The passenger terminal, designed by Francisco Antonio Laprovitera Teixeira, consists of a single block with departure and arrival areas, food kiosks, bathrooms at each extremity, andâunfortunatelyâfew check-in desks. Its 2200m runway is long enough to accommodate an Airbus A320 and its Boeing counterpart, the 737-800. â Itâs served by Azul (Belo Horizonte), Azul Conecta (Fortaleza, ParnaÃ­ba), Gol Transportes AÃ©reos (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos), and LATAM Brasil (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos). The update introduces native MSFS 2024 compatibility, reduced VRAM usage, enhanced LOD optimization, new vegetation models, and terrain CGL changes.  â Itâs available in the Marketplace for $9.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a move that might turn a few heads, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has received a free Stranger Things expansion, created in partnership with Netflix. The package drops the Simmer in Hawkins, Indiana, and asks them to support the town, as it faces lockdowns, patrols, and threats from the Upside Down. At the centre of the expansion is a Bell UH-1H Huey, in Hawkins Heli-Tours colours, flown under the watch of Murray Bauman. Players can complete five story-driven missions that include everything from rescue work to supply runs and chase sequences, before unlocking a tour mode that allows free exploration.Â  The release also adds a detailed recreation of Hawkins, with more than 40 recognisable locations from the series, along with themed avatar outfits and "supernatural encounters. The helicopter itself has been developed by Taogâs Hangar, which is now confirmed as a first-party partner on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.Â Â  The Stranger Things Expansion is available now, through the in-sim Marketplace on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.

    <title>SoFly Confirms December Release For AeroTone Audio Enhancer</title>
    <updated>2025-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/sflyat"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/693a07a04524e948041eb647_aerotone.co_-_Google_Chrome_19-11-2025-22_15_30_b05508c2-0898-49fc-b64a-375a621c6fc5.png"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. SoFly has confirmed that AeroTone, its new audio enhancement add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, will release on Dec. 17, 2025.Â  The product was previously announced under the working title Aircraft Sound Enhancer, and has since been renamed and expanded. AeroTone is built around a custom in-sim panel that runs entirely inside the simulator, with no need for external tools. From this panel, users can adjust individual sound layers, fine-tune levels, and save profiles per aircraft.Â  Settings are stored and recalled from within the cockpit, so you can switch between aircraft and keep separate sound setups without additional configuration. On the audio side, SoFly has partnered with Echo19 to create a high-quality soundscape that reacts to the aircraft and environment. Ground roll, vibration, airframe stress, turbulence, touchdown effects, and avionics noise are all driven by in-sim conditions, with separate treatments for cockpit and cabin views.Â  AeroTone is compatible with every aircraft and vehicle by default, while more than 120 official profiles will ship at launch for popular types. Simmers can also create their own profiles, reset back to an official or community preset if needed, and import community-created configurations.Â  The intention, according to SoFly, is to make AeroTone easy to use for beginners, while still offering enough depth for those who wish to customise every detail. AeroTone also includes regionalised ATC ambience, with many hours of prerecorded chatter, that adapts to your current location and flight phase.Â  Different accent sets cover regions such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, with distinct sets for ground operations and en-route traffic. AeroTone will be available for PC at launch, supporting both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, with game controller support included. SoFly plans to bring the add-on to Xbox and PlayStation 5 via the in-sim Marketplace after the initial release. Pricing has not yet been announced. Learn more here.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a recent Discord post, Skyward Simulations has shared some screenshots and a feature list for their upcoming Citation C680 Sovereign+ for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This will be the team's second project and represents a huge leap for the team. Their first project was the relatively simple Diamond DA-50RG. A far cry from a Citation in both speed and complexity. The team notes how much progress has been made on the new project and promises that a release date announcement is coming soon. So far, the new plane has been confirmed to feature a fully simulated electrical system, anti-ice system, SimBrief integration, checklists, FADEC, autothrottle, EFB, fully modeled interior, G5000 avionics, and much more.Â Â  With their ambitions set so high, hopefully, Skyward Simulations can deliver this beautiful bird to a virtual hangar near you soon. You can check out the full feature list and more on their Discord.Â  Their DA-50RG can be found on the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace and Orbx. It was originally released for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, so it lacks some fidelity on the walkaround, but it still represents an enjoyable experience that will help set your expectations for what is to come. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. BeyondATC has released a YouTube video giving, the community insight into the programâs current status and future.Â  After the team spent 10 months stabilising the program's core features, they announced they are ready to move on to developing visual flight rules (VFR). The team plans to roll out VFR in phases, with coverage expanding over time.  In phase one, VFR coverage will be provided for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with a focus on circuit entry and exit. Phase two will introduce different types of airspace, while phase three will allow the completion of full VFR flights. The team notes that it will take time to roll out these features. However, if the developersâ plans go as expected, simmers will soon have new ways to integrate air traffic control into their flying experience.Â  To learn more about BeyondATC, you can check out their official website.

The profile also exposes controls for ground services, aircraft performance information, ATIS, and various cockpit and cabin features.  It is designed to take advantage of newer MSFS 2024 features, including walkaround and external interaction points. Both 15 and 32 key layouts are included, with support for the Elgato Stream Deck XL, Stream Deck MK.2, Stream Deck Mobile on iOS and Android, and the Corsair Xeneon Edge.Â  The iFly 737 Max 8 Stream Deck profile is available now for $33 from the Flight Panels store and selected third-party marketplaces.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The Flight Sim Awards are coming back for 2026! The first award ceremony we held earlier this year was met with great enthusiasm from both developers and community members. All the feedback and lessons from last year have been taken into account, and efforts have been made to ensure that the Flight Sim Awards 2026 is bigger, better, and ready to celebrate in a meaningful way. The organizing committee, comprising FSElite, Cruiselevel, and Threshold, has been working diligently on the next ceremony, reviewing the structure to ensure a fair, transparent, and meaningful selection process. The awards continue to honour excellence and long-term contributions within the flight simulation community, recognizing achievements in development, creativity, and community engagement. In the updated structure, we aimed to create space for developers and creators who may not have fit naturally into previous categories. Each category has been reviewed to ensure relevance, clarity, and a balanced representation of the many areas that advance our hobby. We also added categories to highlight community contributions, which are often overlooked. All entries are evaluated according to shared principles: Each category represents a part of what makes flight simulation thrive: creativity, precision, and the human dedication behind the virtual skies. More information on the nomination process and jury panel will follow shortly. The next Flight Sim Awards ceremony will once again take place during the Captainâs Dinner at Flight Sim Weekend on Friday, March 20th, 2026. You can find more information on our website and tickets to FlightSimWeekend and the Captains Dinner here. Join the Flight Sim Awards Discord and be a part of the Awards community</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released their first weather-related add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, named âTypical Weather,â due to the fact that it does not use live weather data but a historical compilation of weather figures from around the world, providing a typical METAR for that specific period of the year. Typical Weather is âan intelligent, location-aware weather engine that adapts to where and when you flyâ, bringing a completely new approach to weather in simulators, delivering conditions that make sense for the place you are flying in without the unpredictability of live weather. Parallel 42 argues that live weather is âinconsistentâ, allowing for clear sunny days in the middle of winter, contrary to the expectation of what you would expect from a determined location. Typical Weather prevents that from happening by using historical weather data from over 9,000 weather stations and nearly 20 million sample points, always providing what would be rather usual throughout the year. The plugin also allows the user to choose from atypical conditions if desired, with options ranging from fair to hazy, foggy, windy, precipitating, stormy, or IFR, all based on the region being flown in. Furthermore, the apps panel will also provide a detailed METAR, with wind and gust visualization, and the possibility to synchronize everything for multiplayer sessions, in addition to being either static or dynamic. â Itâs available in their store for $20.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has recently released a hotfix for X-Plane 12 to address a few minor issues found in their latest release.Â  The current iteration of X-Plane has been supported since December 2022. Since that time, many patches have been released, to fix bugs and expand on features.Â  According to this round of patch notes, X-Plane 12.3.3 addresses an issue with the latest version of Nvidia's Graphics Driver, as well as addressing an instancing objects issue within the software development kit.  Mac users are also told to check that they have the latest installer version, 5.2.1. Recent updates have focused on air traffic control, weather, cloud visuals, flight lessons, and general visual enhancements.  According to Laminar Researchâs roadmap, version 12.4 will be a âC-Checkâ, focusing on systems and the user experience.

    <title>PMDGâs 738NG for MSFS 2024 to Release on Thursday</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has published another development update regarding their upcoming 737-800 upgrade for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which will feature a comprehensive overhaul, including a new cabin, new cockpit textures, new sounds, and more. â The developers argue that their original 738 is a really old product in software terms (3.5 years old), and they had not yet fully understood the simulatorâs potential at the time of release. 2024 has given them the opportunity to dive deeper into the potential offered by the new platform and bring it up to modern standards. â Itâs said to be a significant overhaul of the 737 product line, wholly capitalizing on the simâs capabilities: a new cockpit with new materials, lidar scanned models, new lighting, new surface textures; a new cabin, new interactable items around the airplane, customized door logic, operable cockpit windows, and a new 3D sound-set built by a professional sound engineering team whose lead sound engineer is also a type-rated 737 captain. â While there are still some cleanup details to finish around the external area, PMDG hopes to release it on Thursday (18/12), just before Christmas, so people can enjoy their Christmas break flying the brand-new product in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â They have also listed a few FAQ such as price (in line with previous products), discount for previous owners (previous owners will in fact get a discount, both on marketplace and pmdg.com), discount across purchase venues (if you bought it on marketplace, it will be only applicable to marketplace, and so on), and the potential release date for the other 737s (-600 and -900 in January, and -700 in February). âIf you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
