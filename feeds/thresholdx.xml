    <summary>Sim: FS24. REX Simulations has released Atmos CORE, a new atmospheric and weather engine, designed for MSFS 2024. Atmos CORE operates within the simulator engine, providing extra control over how weather, lighting, and atmospheric effects are depicted within the sim. The tool integrates with Asoboâs Live Weather and external engines, such as ActiveSky. You are able to adjust a wide range of variables in real time, including temperature, pressure, wind layers, and cloud formations, as well as more advanced properties, such as Rayleigh scattering, particulate simulation, and ambient lighting. A built-in preset management system allows for saving, sharing, and automatic loading of customised presets. The developer emphasises that Atmos CORE is non-destructive, leaving simulator files untouched and reverting to default states when disabled. REX also notes upcoming integration with its Weather CORE product, and future support dynamic atmospheric adjustments, in real time. Here are some of the key features of the product: Key Featuresâ Atmos CORE is available through the REX Store, for $14.50 excluding sales tax, as well as Simmarket, Contrail, Orbx, Just Flight, Aerosoft, and Flightsim.to. Customers who purchased the original REX Atmos for MSFS 2020 are eligible for a 50% discount, provided the new version is bought from the same vendor.

    <title>iniBuilds Shares Previews of A340-300 for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/340dev"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68b215a34f9ea1e9581a2fc0_FlightSimulator2024_4Hu5ukHv2T.png.930f3ff717475b9025e29cc5a1f0e83b.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. A couple weeks after announcing the project, iniBuilds has finally released the first development update. This time, the focus of the update has been placed on the art section of the development. In contrast from the A350, where the airframe looks relatively new and clean, the A340 has been modelled to the likes of an 20-24 year old aircraft, with a lot of attention given to the small details that emphasize the aircraftâs age, such as hydraulic staining, grease accumulation, panel wear, worn markings, chipped paint, faded text on placards and labels, as well as differences in materials on the aircraft that can be seen after years and years of service and maintenance. Moving on with the update, the next part covers the infamous engines - or shall I say the 4 additional APUs. One of the more interesting features of the engines is the use of the FS24 âshaderâ effect for the engine spinners, making the transitions between different thrust settings look much smoother. The only issue with this effect however, is that the fan is turning the opposite way, due to the current simulator limitations. As with all iniBuilds products, the A340 will also feature openable engine cowlings. â In the performance part of the update, the developers have mentioned that instead of using the traditional 4K/8K liveries, the A340 will feature decal-based liveries, that look better even when using the lower graphical settings and will use less resources. Another advantage of the FS24 is the use of the improved SimObjects system, that has let the developers fine-tune the LOD models, so that the little details can be rendered without the cost of the higher resource usage. In addition to this, a significant number of airline-specific options will be included, with some of them being the SATCOM antenna, ice detection probes, brake fans, etc. As mentioned previously, a lot of attention has been directed on wear and tear on the exterior. The more you fly the aircraft, the more weathering will be seen on the fuselage, for example, speed tape on various parts of the airframe, dents, paint flaking, residue and streaks, as well as tire and brake pin wear.Â  Another area of development that has been showcased were the animations, more specifically, the wingflex. With the wingspan of 60.3 meters, and with two CFM56 engine on the each wing, you can definitely expect a lot of flex. Included in the update was the video showcasing the current state of the wing animations. Aside from the wings, the gear retraction and compression upon touchdown has also been tuned to act like their real-life counterpart. For all the eyecandy lovers out there, iniBuilds has also covered the visual effects: from the wing vapors, engine condensation, over-wing vortices and wingtip trails, to the the heat blur behind the engines and the cold-start smoke. The development update has also mentioned that the A340 will include a lot of interactive hatches with which you can fiddle around during the walkaround mode in FS24: External Power, Engine Cowling, Potable Water, Waste Water, Cargo Door opening, Cargo Control Panel and many more.Â  The most exciting part of the update, at least in my humble opinion, is the inclusion of the EIS1 configuration. Something that has been heavily underrepresented in the flight simulation, will be an option in the A340. While the main focus is on the newer EIS2, the CRT screen configuration will be featured eventually. Lastly, the development has also addressed the cabin. Like with the A350, the A340âs cabin has been modelled based on the cabin of a german carrier too. Once again, thanks to the FS24 systems, the cabin has been modelled in a way that even the users with computers with lower-end specifications will be able to run it with comfortable performance.Â  Another interesting part of the update, this time regarding the cabin, is the preighter configuration. Instead of converting the entire aircraft into the cargo configuration (which takes a lot of time and money), airliners realised that they could just remove the seats from the cabin, and have more space for cargo transport. This configuration was especially popular during the COVID pandemic, as the airlines had no passenger service, while the amount of freight to be moved was only rising. In the iniBuilds rendition of the preighter configuration, you can walk around the cabin and open containers carrying food, medical supplies, parcels, car parts, flowers, live animals and more. Currently, no release date, nor the price of the upcoming iniBuilds A340 has been announced, but as always Threshold will keep you updated! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!Â  â</summary>

    <title>Just Flight Shares Extensive Development Update on F70/F100 for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfdevf"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. With the release of Just Flightâs Fokker 70 and 100 drawing ever closer, the developer has issued what it says will likely be the final text-based update before pre-release coverage begins. The latest report highlights progress across cockpit systems, cabin features, and the remaining technical hurdles before release. Recent weeks have seen major avionics fall into place, including the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and weather radar. The TCAS now produces traffic and resolution advisories, under the correct conditions, displaying intruder aircraft on the navigation display with colour-coded symbols and trend indicators. The weather radar, meanwhile, renders precipitation returns directly, on the EFIS display, graded by intensity, from green to red. Alongside these core systems, smaller quality-of-life features are also appearing. An interactive speed flipchart sits beside the captainâs display, automatically calculating take-off and landing speeds, or allowing manual reference by weight. Interactive paper checklists make a return, being mounted on the yokeâs chart holder, and illuminated by a built-in light, for night operations. Customisation has been a particular focus. Each default livery is equipped with accurate airline-specific configurations, drawn from research of real-world operators, including lighting options and units of measurement. Additional features, such as IRS alignment times, pilot callouts, and sun visor visibility, can be managed through the EFB. The Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) itself has been modelled with a new black design, available in both wall- and window-mounted variants. As in Just Flightâs other airliners, the EFB houses payload controls, fuel management, checklists, and configuration tools. Beyond the cockpit, the developers have continued to expand cabin functionality. Calls between crew stations are now fully modelled, complete with audible tones and call lights. Cabin lighting systems have been fine-tuned across all variants, controlled from the galley, while the digital music player has returned, with new support for passenger announcements. These can be triggered manually or set to run automatically, through an âAuto Cabin Crewâ option. While much has been completed, attention remains on the interconnected Automatic Flight Control and Augmentation System (AFCAS), Autothrottle System (ATS), and Flight Management System (FMS). Just Flight describes these as some of the most complex features it has attempted, currently handled by a full-time developer, focused entirely on these systems. Other work continues on the custom sound set, which now includes cabin announcements and pilot callouts. As with other aspects of the aircraft, the development team is in regular consultation with real-world Fokker pilots, to verify behaviour in areas not covered by the official manuals. Just Flight expects this to be the final written entry before video previews and pre-release coverage take over, finally bringing demonstrations of the highly anticipated aircraft in action. You can read the full development update from Just Flight on their website. We'll keep you updated leading up to release.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Azrsim has recently released their rendition of Heydar Aliyev International Airport (UBBB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Baku, Azerbaijan, and has a yearly average of 7.5 million passengers. The airport opened in 1933, and the first scheduled route started a few years later, taking 15 passengers to Moscow. In the late 1930s, two new routes were added, including Rostov and Grozny, to the destination roster. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1964, increasing its passenger handling capabilities and attracting new operators and routes. In late 1990, Baku gained its international status while opening up for flights outside of the Soviet Union, which was already in the process of dissolution after the massive crisis that spiraled post-Chernobyl and Gorbachev's own measures to "lift" the invisible shielding dome. In 1997, a new passenger terminal, Terminal 2, was presented. In 1998, a new runway was opened to make operations even smoother for airlines and passengers.Â  Terminal 2 was inaugurated only 2 years after its official presentation, and President Heydar Aliyev was among the attendees. In mid-2004, a new domestic terminal was inaugurated, quickly becoming one of the country's most important domestic hubs. â A new passenger terminal project was announced in 2011, and it opened in 2014, three years later.Â  Later that same year, Baku Airport earned its first 4-star ranking on Skytrax, which it repeated in 2016. In 2018, it earned a 5-star rating in the regional airport category, according to Skytrax. In 2023, it was also the first airport in the world to completely switch to cloud technologies, which helped it earn the Best Airport in Central Asia and CIS award in 2024, which it had also won five times in a row before. It's a hub for Azerbaijan Airlines, Azal Avia Cargo, Silk Way West Airlines, ASG Business Aviation, and Silk Way Airlines. Aegean Airlines, Aeroflot, Air Arabia, Air Astana, Air Cairo, Air Montenegro, AJet, arkia, Belavia, Centrum Air, China Southern Airlines, Etihad Airways, Flyadeal, Flynas, Gulf Air, Iran Air, Iraq Airways, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Pakistan International Airlines, Qatar Airways, Red Wings Airlines, S7 Airlines, SCAT Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Ural Airlines, Uzbekistan Airways, and Wizz Air also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed terminal buildings, high-resolution ground textures, dynamic night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. It's available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $24.32, requiring at least 12.26 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Bluebird Simulations has today issued an update on its Boeing 757 for MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, setting out what has moved forward, what remains, and how the team will proceed. Furthermore, Bluebird is planning two more video previews before release, with the first due for Q4 of this year, focused on system depth. The headline item is the pneumatic system, which Bluebird says has reached a new milestone and has been a major time sink in recent months. Alongside that, LNAV and VNAV are reported to be about 70% complete. Additional systems, including doors, oxygen system, and landing gear logic, have progressed in parallel. The 757 currently features 153 working circuit breakers, with Bluebird targeting more than 200 by release. The upcoming Q4 video will walk through a broader set of systems, pneumatics, the FMS, landing gear, ice and rain protection, oxygen, and doors, to show how they tie together in day-to-day use. A final pre-release video is planned to concentrate on remaining areas, with the EFB still flagged as the largest single item to be wrapped up. Bluebird has begun more extensive testing in MSFS 2024, and the latest screenshots have been taken there. The team describes the 2024 build as work-in-progress to offer a âcompatibleâ version, at or shortly after release. A fully native MSFS 2024 edition is intended to follow later. Development on MSFS 2020 continues in tandem, which should help maintain feature parity, while the 2024 path matures. Internal testing has focused on stabilising core systems, before handing the aircraft off to external testers. With the pneumatic work now in place, Bluebird says it is approaching the first stage of beta in the coming weeks. Some items typically reserved for later testing, such as door logic, oxygen, and landing gear behaviour, have already been advanced to reduce risk, as the 757 heads towards broader evaluation. Bluebird reiterated that the Boeing 757 will cost $80 USD. The purchase will include both the 757-200 and 757-300, with Rolls-Royce and Pratt &amp; Whitney engine options, for both simulators. For 2024, a âcompatibleâ version will be released first, while a native version is planned for âmuch laterâ.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSDG has released Salerno Costa dâAmalfi (LIRI) for MSFS 2020 and 2024, introducing a rather compact coastal airport in a stunning part of Italy. The package already arrives with an initial maintenance update applied (v1.1), which aims to address early issues. Set just short of 25 miles south-east of Naples, Salerno sits between sea and foothills, which shapes both the approaches and the kind of flying it invites. The real-world runway has been extended to around 1,600 metres, and the scenery reflects that updated layout, opening the door to everything from general aviation to smaller airliners. Arrivals over the shoreline are framed by rising terrain, while departures quickly put Mount Vesuvius, the Amalfi Coast, and the Bay of Naples within easy reach. On the ground, FSDGâs rendition features interior modelling, revised ground layouts, and optimised performance. The team has also modelled the surrounding greenhouse belts, which sit close to the traffic pattern, with their glass roofs being notorious for kicking back reflections onto the arriving traffic, in real life. Salerno Costa dâAmalfi is available now from FSDG and partner stores, priced at roughly $15,18 USD, including taxes.Â Marketplace release is planned for next week.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Five weeks after the aircraftâs initial release, FlightFX has issued version 1.3.6 of its C750 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing the Citation X's first big update. The update introduces a wide-ranging set of refinements across the aircraftâs visuals, handling, and systems, alongside improvements to its integrated V.A.M.S. 2.0 interface.Â  Key changes include the addition of a VR collision mesh and a new co-pilot camera view. Exterior lighting has been overhauled, with corrected intensities, positions and rotations, as well as LED-style strobe and beacon lights, for winglet-equipped airframes. Improvements were also made to the cabin lighting LODs. Graphical fixes have addressed texture gaps and lighting misalignments, while sound changes were made to engine start volume, wind noise and exterior exhaust tones. The FADEC logic now better handles low-altitude cruise thrust, and high-altitude fuel flow discrepancies have been adjusted. Furthermore, ground handling has been retuned, with a focus on tiller sensitivity and yaw behaviour, plus a new option to separate rudder and tiller inputs. Thrust reverser logic has been significantly revised, with faster bucket deployment, smoother N1 ramping, and more consistent autothrottle transitions. Avionics fixes range from functional autopilot disengagement to SimBrief import errors and VSD indicators. Support for 8.33 kHz spacing has been added, alongside improvements to crossbleed logic, TOD behaviour and flight plan sequencing. The Virtual Aircraft Management System (V.A.M.S.) has seen some targeted fixes as well, including chock logic, tablet stability in third-party views, and toggle settings for tiller control. A redundant OpenStreetMap link has also been removed for clarity. For the full changelog, use this link to visit FlightFXâs Discord server. FlightFX has also updated the accompanying instruction manual, available for free on Google Drive.Â  The FlightFX Cessna Citation X is available exclusively on the in-sim Marketplace, for $29.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations has recently issued a new update to their A320 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, introducing tweaks to the fly-by-wire roll, an autothrust overhaul, and performance improvements. Update 2.4.0.2225 is the first update after the so-called âBig Fenix Updateâ, further enhancing the work on the flight model with fly-by-wire ground roll improvements, and a complete rebuild of the autothrust system, replicating how the real A320 behaves with broader tolerances and targeting smoothness rather than responsively abrupt as it used to be before, being almost âtoo goodâ rather than delivering a real representation of how the system truly works.Â  The new autothrust is said to be âslightly more intelligentâ than before and might be a few knots off the target speed. However, that is because it works within the internally defined tolerances to smooth out any necessary changes, making the flight more comfortable and fuel efficient.Â  Furthermore, soft cruise was also tweaked, with more deviation during the ALT CRZ phase, to ensure passenger comfort by trading energy across speed and altitude to avoid changing thrust. While this system was in place beforehand, the old autothrust behavior would not allow it to kick in properly. â The fly-by-wire roll was also tweaked to achieve closer results to the real counterpart, with a greater sense of inertia on the roll axis. They validated the behavior on three different Level D simulators, where all of them behaved differently to an extent, but they managed to find a middle ground using a mixture of the Level D testing, pilot feedback, and the datasets they used to adjust their control responses. They have adapted their roll PID controllers for better granular control, adding a new damping channel for certain conditions, allowing for greater control overall. â The new update also improves the sounds - especially the CFM56 engine variant -and the core display rendering system has been changed, aiming to simplify it for everyone, while increasing its robustness and performance. The complete changelog for the update follows below: Avionics and Systems â â Art and Sound â â EFB â Fenixâs A320 lineup is available on their website for $120.90 (full bundle), or $67.17 (A320 only) + $53.73 (A319+A321).Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlightControlTools has recently released FlightControlSpotter, a brand-new utility for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, that puts you in the shoes of a virtual plane spotter. Bringing a new angle to your replays, this tool enables jumping into tower views and custom vantage points. Fully integrated as an in-sim toolbar panel, FlightControlSpotter lets you teleport straight to the nearest airport tower, browse nearby fields by ICAO code, or drop yourself onto a runway, apron stand, or even a completely custom spot anywhere in the world. Your favourite locations can be saved for later, with a dedicated interface for managing them.Â  Custom spots are supported too, with latitude, longitude, and altitude being able to be captured from the aircraft or avatar, or entered manually, using coordinates. These locations can then be stored and named. View management is handled in the panel, with options to load or delete saved positions. Here's the full feature list: For the complete announcement, you can read it here. The utility relies on MSFSâs drone camera, which provides free movement, zoom, and angles without interfering with the aircraft state. When it is time to fly, a shortcut returns the user to the cockpit and restores full control. FlightControlSpotter is available now through SimMarket, with an introductory price of $14.57, excluding taxes, for the first month.Â There is also a bundle offer including FlightControlReplay 5, for $34.96, excluding taxes, while existing FlightControlReplay 5 owners benefit from an upgrade price of $11.65 The add-on is currently only for PC, supporting both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024. An Xbox version âmay follow laterâ. An accompanying PDF manual can also be downloaded here. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>TFDi Design Shares Work on MD-11 Update, Xbox/MSFS 2024 support</title>
    <updated>2025-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mdsepu"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68b8b31512480ab94e53eb44_ext_klm_1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. TFDi Design has posted a sizeable development update on its MD-11, covering progress across art, systems, and the new Extended Simulation package. While the original 60-day target for MSFS 2024 support has now slipped, the aircraft is receiving a significant visual overhaul, enhanced systems depiction, and a clearer roadmap, towards both MSFS 2024 and Xbox. As previously teased, the aircraft has received a major art overhaul, starting with a completely rebuilt exterior model. Animations have been corrected, surface textures reworked, and missing details have been filled in. Service ports now carry legible labels, while flap and slat internals animate with a new layer of mechanical fidelity, with more physical parts depicted. Rivets, dirt, and fine panel work have also seen major attention, overall raising the visual fidelity of the aircraft. Furthermore, Pratt &amp; Whitney engine options will be released alongside the upcoming art update. Behind the scenes, the throttle control system and engine simulation have also been reworked. Moving to the interior, the cabin has seen a similar overhaul of visual fidelity, being almost entirely reworked. Included are new textures, remodelled geometry, and glass/rain surface effects on the windows, with the team also hinting at a few surprises yet to be shown.Â  In the cockpit, smaller missing items are being addressed, including the manual gear handle, oxygen test buttons, and a few immersion items, including openable cockpit windows. Another large iteration on the code side is the Extended Simulation package. TFDi has implemented more than 160 failure scenarios, with user controls to adjust likelihood and scope, so that IVAO and VATSIM flying remains viable.Â  A new maintenance system has replaced the instant âfix allâ pop-ups with maintenance flows, repairs, and routine service checks. Each airframe also builds its own local log over time, tracking its own maintenance history. When it comes to core systems, PROF descent logic has been overhauled for steadier vertical profiles, step climbs now handle multiple S/C and T/C points, and support for ATO waypoints has been added. A custom simulation for oil, vibration, and EGT has also been implemented across both P3D and MSFS, alongside display improvements and many bug fixes. While the art update and Extended Simulation package are nearly complete for MSFS PC, work on FS24 is taking longer than expected. TFDi plans to split the model where necessary, adopt the simâs new texture streaming format, and integrate FS24-native features, so the aircraft feels at home in the new platform. Xbox releases are expected to land alongside FS24 PC, once testing is complete. There is still no firm release date.Â  TFDi reports that QA feedback on the refreshed model and Extended Simulation has been positive, and the team maintains that it remains focused on delivering the MD-11 as "originally envisioned". The team admits the delay is not ideal, but states the wait will be "worth it", and TFDi characterises the remaining work as a matter of âa few weeksâ.Â  â For the full details, you can read TFDi's development update on their website.

    <title>Thranda Design Releases F33A Bonanza for XP12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda Design has recently released the F33A Bonanza for X-Plane 12, positioning the classic Beechcraft as the next step in the studioâs Dynamic Generation Series.Â  As with other aircraft in the Dynamic Generation Series, the Bonanzaâs panel is not fixed in place. More than 60 instruments can be mixed and matched, moved between pilot and co-pilot positions, and saved as reusable presets. Support is included for RealityXP, as well as TDS GTN 650/750 units, GNS 430/530 swaps, and even G1000-style layouts, allowing the aircraft to be configured to suit various training needs, vintage tastes, or IFR touring preferences. Paintwork is handled in-sim, through Thrandaâs dynamic livery editor. Liveries can be adjusted on the fly, with colour selection, roughness and metallic variables, and optional wear layers, before being rasterised to the textures for later use.Â  The EFB provides options such as covers, chocks, doors, and lighting, a visual weight and balance tool, ground handling, a panel layout editor, and quality-of-life apps, including checklists, a logbook view, and AviTab integration, when installed. Tip tanks can also be toggled from the EFB, with corresponding changes to weight, drag, and handling. Under the skin, the model is built around 8k textures and full PBR materials, with per-instrument post-lighting and rain effects. An FMOD sound set is used for sounds, layering cockpit clicks, airflow cues, and exterior perspectives, aiming to reflect changes in load, slip, and angle of attack. The Continental IO-520-B piston engine is modelled with detailed performance envelopes, and the electrical system includes buses, tie breakers, and failure modes. Thranda says flight dynamics were tuned with input from real-world F33A pilots, so numbers for take-off, climb, cruise, and landing are intended to sit close to the book, while still leaving room for the Bonanzaâs quirks, when pushed. For upkeep, support forr the SkunkCraft Updater is in place to handle incremental changes. Feature-rich Universal Electronic Flight Bag (UEFB) with pop-up/pop-out capability with the following features: For full feature information, visit the F33A's product page. The Thranda Design F33A Bonanza is available via the X-Plane.org Store for $37.95, currently on a 16% discount. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.3.0 Beta, Weather Update, Aircraft Rework</title>
    <updated>2025-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1230"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68b9902421a2d9942ee67742_WXRUpdate_TItle_3%20(1).webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has just rolled out the first beta of X-Plane 12.3.0, and it is one of the most ambitious updates we have seen yet. Headlining the release is a fully simulated weather radar system, alongside a major overhaul of the default Airbus A330, and a bundle of new tools for both pilots and developers. The new weather radar is available across several default aircraft, including the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A330-300, Citation X, and Baron 58. Being fully simulated, the system is capable of tilt and gain control, turbulence detection, ground clutter suppression and more, with accurate attenuation and reflections. For GA flyers, the X1000 GPS now integrates radar returns directly onto the display, and the Baron has received an open-source Bendix RDR2000 implementation. This new functionality, however, only integrates with the default fleet at launch, where third-party developers can integrate the new technology with their own updates, should they want to. As part of this beta, Laminar Research has also reworked the native Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), which should result in better terrain and obstacle alerts, when flying into challenging conditions. Combined with the weather radar, situational awareness takes a serious leap forward in 12.3.0. The default Airbus A330 has not been left out either, and the widebody was given a âcomplete overhaulâ. The exterior now sports micro-textures, subtle dirt and weathering effects, and even animated engine wobble. Inside, both cockpit and cabin lighting have been rebuilt with backlit instruments, spill lighting, dynamic cabin lamps, and even an auto-adjusting cabin brightness function. Moving on to systems, work has been done on refining VNAV logic, flight control laws, and autopilot behaviour, while also introducing a functional SEC F-PLN: Secondary Flight Plan Page.  Another big addition is Synthetic Vision for the X1000 avionics, a feature widely used in modern GA avionics. This system can paint a 3D representation of terrain, runways, and obstacles directly onto the Primary Flight Display, ensuring safer low-visibility operations. Not content with just systems and avionics, Laminar has also added a new, hand-crafted rendition of Dubai International Airport (OMDB) in the United Arab Emirates. The airport features custom terminal buildings and detailed surroundings, making the worldâs busiest international hub a more authentic stopover for long-haul operations in the sim. Another subtle addition in is the new Engine Health system, this being a fully native wear-and-tear implementation. Here, developers can assign different âagesâ to each engine at load, so one might behave like a well-worn unit with 7.7 years behind it, while the other is a fresher 3.2 years old. This results in small variations in spool-up times, fuel flow, and overall efficiency, between the two powerplants.  Elsewhere, X-Plane 12.3.0 now introduces the option to load historical weather conditions up to a year in the past, allowing real-world flights or test scenarios to be recreated under authentic conditions.Â Scenery developers have also gained some new tools, including vegetation annotations for 3D objects, updated ground textures, and fresh airport assets. For cockpit builders, avionics displays, such as the G1000 and G530, can now be assigned directly to hardware screens, rather than pop-ups. The G-Loaded Camera now comes with an intensity slider, and a command to suspend the effect altogether, based on user feedback.  You can read the feature list below: For the full list of fixes, features, and improvements, you can check out the complete release notes on the official X-Plane website. X-Plane 12.3.0 is now available for all who opt into the public beta. Steam users can join via the âbetaâ branch, while Laminar Direct customers can tick the beta box in the X-Plane 12 installer.
