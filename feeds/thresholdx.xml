    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has just teased their next aircraft release, hinting at a classic, steam-gauge Cessna 172.  The screenshot shows a polished, early-production airframe, at golden hour, captioned âCarenado 172 Oneseventytwoâ, which strongly suggests a recreation of an early 172 model, rather than a later, Skyhawk-branded airframe. Carenado added that they hope we can âenjoy it in a couple of daysâ, though there is no firm date or feature list yet. From the cues on show, this looks like the original 172 that debuted in the 1950s. That aircraft evolved from the Cessna 170B, with tricycle landing gear. If confirmed, it will sit apart from the default 172S, found in MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024.Â  The modern Skyhawk uses a 180-horsepower, fuel-injected Lycoming IO-360, carries the aerodynamic refinements of later production, and typically tops out at 30 degrees of flap. The early 172 ran a carburetted Continental O-300 six-cylinder engine, offered up to 40 degrees of flap for short-field work, and is often noted for friendly, low-speed handling. Carenado has not shared pricing or platform details yet, but their aircraft usually arrive via the in-sim Marketplace.  Threshold will keep you updated on all the latest.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Black Square has rolled out v0.1.2 for both the Piston Duke and Turbine Duke, bringing full MSFS 2024 compatibility, a raft of new interactions, and a long list of fixes. The headline addition is an expanded pre-flight walk-around for 2024, complete with collision models and clickspots for chocks, pitot covers, doors, and baggage bays. Both aircraft gain a new headphone simulation, with adjustable attenuation, refreshed interior lighting, new magnetic compass effects, GTNxi 750/650 bezels, support for TDS GTNxi Advanced Crossfill, and quality-of-life tweaks across the tablet, legacy radios, and animations.Â  Black Square has also implemented a workaround for MSFS 2024âs dynamic registration quirk, restored cockpit precipitation sounds, improved oxygen logic in pressurised scenarios, and provided a batch of avionics and systems fixes. The Turbine Duke receives further love, with a smoother prop governor model, an âInstant Beta on Touchdownâ option for reliable beta entry after landing, new engine-driven fuel pump failure logic, faster torque indication changes, and additional polish to the cabin visualiser.Â  The Piston Duke received new oil-pump failure and engine-seizing physics, along with custom toe-brake animations, that play nicely with the parking brake. Across both packages, numerous niggles have been addressed, from reversed glideslope sensing on the copilot side to tablet refresh delays to oddities in heater blower behaviour on hot days, aiming for cleaner ops in both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024. Updates and corresponding changelogs are available through the Contrail app. New customers can purchase both aircraft for $50.89 separately, or together in a bundle, for $72.10, also through Contrail.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. The long-awaited MiG-29A Fulcrum has finally been released in early access form! One of the most popular fighter jets of all time, with over 1,600 units built, has been brought to DCS by Eagle Dynamics. Developed by Mikoyan and Gurevich Design Bureau during the 1970s, along with the Sukhoi Su-27, it was built to oppose the American F-15 and F-16. Originally designed as an air superiority fighter, the Fulcrum has slowly transitioned to a multirole fighter throughout its service life, with many of them being retrofitted to use air-to-surface and precision munitions. Today, the MiG-29 is used by 25 air forces around the globe. The Eagle Dynamicsâ rendition of this fighter jet features a fully interactive cockpit based on 3D scanning and photogrammetry, a highly detailed external and pilot model, high-fidelity aircraft systems, fully-developed navigation system with multiple modes (POINT-TO-POINT, RETURN, LANDING, TRAFFIC RE-ENTRY), realistic modelling of RWR, flare dispenser system, FIre Control Radar, basic IFF (Identity Friend or Foe), Early Access Guide, Training Missions, as well as a full russian cockpit, with an option for a cockpit and technical inscriptions in English. At the final release, the module will also feature Ground Control Intercept (GCI) command system, a fully modelled IFF, a complete flight manual, a campaign by Eagle Dynamics, and a larger number of liveries and missions. â The full feature list is as follows: The MiG-29A Fulcrum module is currently on an Early Access sale, and is available for purchase at the DCS E-Shop for $63.99, with the price increasing to $79.99 after the saleâs end (keep in mind that this module is incompatible with the Steam version of DCS!), and requires at least 2.64GB of free disk space.

    <title>MicroProse Previews B-17 Flying Fortress for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MicroProse is bringing one of aviationâs most legendary aircraft to Microsoft Flight Simulator, and recently shared a new update on the project. The B-17 Flying Fortress is now deep in development, for both MSFS 2020 and 2024. A trailer shared on YouTube gives us a closer look at the project, which is being built in partnership with Hangar Thirteen and the 100th Bomb Group Foundation. The aircraft is part of MicroProseâs Heritage Valor Collection, a series focused on recreating iconic warbirds, with the highest possible fidelity. According to MicroProse, the B-17 will feature a detailed flight model, authentic sound recordings from surviving aircraft, and hand-crafted 4K PBR textures, that show every rivet, scuff, and patch of wear. The team is also promising a faithful recreation of the bomberâs complex systems, from electrical power, to crew operations, all designed to immerse simmers in what it was like to fly one of these heavy bombers, as close as possible. For many, the B-17 needs little introduction. It was the backbone of the USAAFâs daylight bombing campaign over Europe, famed for both its firepower, and durability. Now, MicroProse wants to capture that same spirit in the virtual skies, bringing the Flying Fortress back to life, for a new generation to enjoy. The project is still in development, with no firm release date yet, but MicroProse has confirmed it will be available through the in-sim Marketplace, once complete.

    <title>FlightSim Studio Previews Super27 Expansion for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fssu27"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68cc92651f76e09c34cd7489_S27-Focus1-header.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlightSim Studio has recently previewed its upcoming Super27 expansion for the Boeing 727, building upon the original base package, with more modern equipment and several new additions. The Super27 expansion was first announced back in June. Since then, the team has posted two detailed updates, titled "Focus #1" and "Focus #2", that sketch a clear picture of what this retrofit will bring to the table. The first post set the scene with visuals and core changes. The 727 receives the real-world Super 27 treatment: uprated JT8D-217C pod engines, with clamshell reversers, plus a centre JT8D-17A upgrade. They are larger, quieter, and give the jet its distinctive Super27 silhouette. New operator liveries are included for both freighter and passenger variants, and you can adapt existing paints easily, as the exterior textures are largely unchanged, beyond of course, the new powerplants. Inside the cockpit, the flight engineerâs fuel gauges move to digital readouts, according to the new avionics layout. A combined digital VSI, with integrated TCAS, arrives, paired with a new transponder.  There is also an Apollo MX20 moving map, that can replace the weather-radar dummy.  The headline tease is a retrofitted Collins EFIS, EADI and EHSI, with matching control panels, plus an accompanying autopilot, and VNAV (descent) support. The EFIS is optional, and can be toggled on the clipboard, for those who prefer the classic six-pack. The second post dives deeper. That TCAS-equipped VSI and its transponder can be enabled in the base 727, once the Super27 is installed. An auto-spoiler arm feature is also included in the upcoming package. Radio-nav fans get dual DME recievers, enabling proper cross-bearing fixes, without a map. The EFIS fit is specified as a Rockwell Collins EFIS-86C. The EADI provides flight-director commands, mode annunciations, speed cues, and deviation scales. The EHSI, meanwhile, offers a compass rose, expanded, and map-with-route views, with ranges up to 600 NM, and selectable data such as wind and groundspeed. Tying it together is a Collins APS-85 autopilot, available with the EFIS, and dual GNS-XLS FMS. Mode selection sits on the glareshield, with sensible fallbacks, to roll hold and vertical speed. Lateral capability runs from heading and NAV tracking to CAT II approaches. Vertically, expect pitch and VS modes, SPEED, with IAS/Mach logic, altitude hold and capture, VNAV path following from the FMS, and a yoke-triggered go-around mode.Â  The Super27 expansion is an add-on to the existing 727. You need the base package, and the expansion covers passenger and freighter variants you already own. FlightSim Studio furthermore says video previews are imminent. A release window has not been given. For the full details, visit this link, for Focus #1, or this link, for Focus #2. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Brazil Land Games Previews Belo Horizonte International Airport v2 for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/blgbelzonte"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68ccd6a469d3072fda647ce0_belzonte1.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Brazil Land Games recently previewed their progress on their upcoming Belo Horizonte/Confins Tancredo Neves International Airport (SBCF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, with a yearly average of 12.3 million passengers. It was built in the early 1980s by Infraero, a state-owned airport management company. At the time, the airportâs main purpose was to help lessen the congestion at Pampulha Airport, which used to be Belo Horizonteâs only airport. It was operating at 120% of its capacity, with no possibility of expansion. Its slightly inconvenient location did not help with the passenger figures at first: while they assumed it would hit the two million passenger mark by 1990, that only happened 22 years after its inauguration. Pampulha Airport was still fairly more convenient for the locals. It wasnât until 2005 that the government decided to ânerfâ Pampulha with a restriction: planes with more than 50 seats could not operate there anymore, forcing it to become a regional-only airport. Over 130 flights were transferred to Confins that year, and the traffic figures went from 300,000 to 3 million passengers in the blink of an eye. The government did try its best to mitigate the accessibility issues by improving the highway that links the city to the airport, significantly reducing the time needed to reach the airport.Â  A new terminalâTerminal 2âwas built in 2015, 31 years after Terminal 1âs inauguration. The new infrastructure can handle up to 22 million passengers annually, giving SBCF some breathing room for many years. Itâs a hub for Azul Linhas AÃ©reas and Gol Transportes AÃ©reos. Copa Airlines, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Sky Airline, and TAP Air Portugal also serve it. The scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom ground service equipment, high-detail buildings, custom jetways, a custom terminal interior, and more. â Thereâs no information regarding availability and pricing yet.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Following last weekâs teasers, Carenado has released its classic, steam-gauge Cessna 172, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.Â Carenado's rendition models the very original, early-production lineage from 1956, which pre-dates the modern Skyhawk.  Expect a cabin full of round dials, a period interior, and short-field friendly flap travel, which sets it apart from the default 172S in MSFS 2024. The aircraft comes in several variants, including with and without wheel covers. If you enjoy steam gauges, pattern work, and low-and-slow sightseeing, this looks like a nice addition. Carenadoâs classic Cessna 172 is available on the MSFS 2024 Marketplace, for $14.99. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>WINWING Releases Boeing-Style EFIS Panels: 3N PDC &amp; 3M PDC Now Available</title>
    <updated>2025-09-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Winwingâs new 3N PDC and 3M PDC panels are now available to buy, bringing a new, Boeing-style EFIS to your desktop.  They slot neatly on either side of the already released PAP 3 Autopilot Panel, for a full 737-style glareshield, and can also be used standalone. The product range has been split into two variants, to mirror the real aircraft: The 3N PDC covers the 737 NG, meaning it has no Vertical Situation Display button, as well as a labelled range scale, with eight detents on a 210-degree selector, numerical markings, and the expected mode and baro interactions. Meanwhile, the 3M PDC (737 MAX-style) features a dedicated VSD button, a detent-free 360Â° encoder, with simple minus/plus direction marks, and revised labelling, to match the IRL MAX. Both products ship with left and right glare shields in the box, allowing you to swap between captain and first officer layouts. Additionally, both support the multi-panel backlight sync feature, through SimAppPro.Â  Furthermore, the centre (CTR) push switch is correctly inhibited in PLN mode, matching the real limitation. Youâll get full-structure moulded faces, with sharp 3D detailing, individual switches for MINS RST, BARO STD, CTR, and TFC, plus authentic auto-reset logic on MINS and BARO selectors. Each unit connects over its own USB and can be used standalone, paired together NG/MAX, or integrated with the PAP3 autopilot panel, for a complete Boeing-style glareshield. As for compatibility, Winwing lists native or active development support. Included for MSFS 2020/2024 are; the PMDG 737, 777, Asobo/Working Title 747 and 787, and the iFly 737 MAX. On the X-Plane-side, Winwing so far supports the Zibo 737, Laminar 737-800 &amp; 747-400, and FlightFactor 777.Â  Further aircraft, including classic jets, like the FSS 727-200 Advanced, and Aeroplane Heaven 707, are flagged as upcoming.  The products went live earlier today, and global listings are live with limited stock, with regional pricing being published as follows, for a single unit: Note that regional sites may adjust prices for exchange rates, and shipping or tax may apply to the global store. For all your 737 adventures, these PDCs complete the picture, modelling the respective differences between the NG and MAX, standalone or in combination with the PAP3 MCP.Â You can find them both on the Winwing store, available together in a combo for $175.00, or sold separately, for $87.50.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. After releasing the A320neo for X-Plane in 2023, ToLiss has announced that the much-loved A320ceo will soon join the line-up, coming for X-Plane 12 next Friday, as an expansion package. First launched in the mid-1980s and entering service with Air France in 1988, the A320ceo was revolutionary for introducing all-digital, fly-by-wire controls to the airliner market. The family grew to include the A318, A319, and A321, and became a workhorse for airlines across the globe. The ToLiss A320ceo will come with both the CFM56-5B4 and IAE V2527-A5 powerplants, and will require the ToLiss A320neo base package to run. ToLiss has confirmed that pre-release copies of the A320ceo expansion will be going out to streamers and reviewers very soon, so expect full previews, walkthroughs, and performance showcases in the coming days. ToLiss hasnât confirmed which platforms it will release on just yet, but going by past launches, you can expect to see it available through the X-Plane.org Store, Aerosoft , and Simmarket. For the full post, visit this link. The ToLiss A320ceo is releasing Friday, Sep. 26. The expansion will be priced at $29.95.  For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. TEIKOF Studio has just released Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport (SKBQ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport serves Barranquilla, the capital of the AtlÃ¡ntico department in Colombia. It was originally opened in 1981 and is named after Ernesto Cortissoz, a pioneer of Colombian aviation. Today, it is a focus city for both Avianca and the somewhat controversial airline, Aeroscure. With just under 3 million passenger movements per year, the airport can accommodate widebody aircraft, including the Boeing 747, with its 3-kilometre-long single runway. TEIKOF Studio's virtual recreation of Ernesto Cortissoz features accurately modelled airport facilities, high-resolution PBR textures, custom ground markings, immersive night lighting, and more. The Airport is available for PC and Xbox on the in-game Marketplace for $16.99, and is compatible with both MSFS 2020 and 2024. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. AzurPoly has just shared a new development update on their upcoming officially licensed Dassault Rafale for Microsoft Flight Simulator. AzurPoly states that the majority of the remaining work involves developing the unique systems for the Rafale. These systems have been entirely created from scratch due to their specificity. We didn't receive a significant update about the exterior model; however, AzurPoly noted that they are "really happy with how it's turning out." They also stated that the level of detail for the Rafale has been enhanced even further than what they achieved with the Jaguar. Cockpit modelling and texturing have progressed significantly since the last development update. As a result, AzurPoly has begun sharing interior screenshots. However, AzurPoly states that things may be subject to change. MSFS 2020 compatibility remains uncertain, with AzurPoly noting that MSFS 2024 presents significantly better options overall, including enhanced visuals and performance. Nonetheless, a port for MSFS 2020 is still a possibility. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has announced the infamous Wolfâs Fang Runway (AT98) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, a recreation of the private Antarctic ice strip, operated by White Desert. The scenery is planned as freeware, with a release marked as âcoming soonâ. The package focuses on the siteâs distinctive blue-ice runway and expedition outpost. iniBuilds says the team has produced a bespoke texture set for ice and snow, custom lighting suited to the environment, and hand-placed clutter, such as tents, vehicles, and static aircraft. The airport layout reflects the current real-world position. Level of detail optimisation is applied across models, and the scenery uses the latest MSFS SDK features for performance. Wolfâs Fang also ties into long-range operations from Cape Town International. Each season, Hi Flyâs Airbus A340-300 and other types connect Cape Town to Wolfâs Fang, over roughly 2,600 nautical miles. iniBuilds highlights that the route can be recreated in MSFS 2024, alongside its Cape Town (FACT) scenery and forthcoming A340 airliner. âScenery Features Weâll keep you updated on Wolfâs Fang and its release.
