    <title>LevelUp Announces 737NG V2 for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. LevelUp recently announced the 737NG V2, which wholly revamps the visuals and sounds for X-Plane 12. The new platformâs rendering capabilities help push the overall fidelity even higher. The polygonal resolution across major external features was doubled, and cylindrical elements of the visual model, such as engine cowlings, fuselage, and gear tyres, were upscaled to look substantially smoother. Furthermore, the scimitar and non-winglet wingtips got a makeover to look better. The texture department has also seen major upgrades, with 8K textures for the landing gear, fuselage, and tail, improving the modelâs overall consistency. The cabin didnât escape the refurbishment either. Brand new modeling and 8K textures throughout allowed LevelUp to properly reflect how most modern cabins look. The sound department saw a major revamp. It now uses FMOD 2.0, brings sounds with much more detail than before, and plays more sounds at once since X-Plane 12 doesnât suffer from the same limitation that X-Plane 11 did, which limited the number of sounds you could play at the same time. The interior sounds also have their own sound set, greatly increasing the experience. The deployment will happen in two stages, with the first stage bringing the new visuals and sounds, and the second stage bringing the new cockpit model and textures. They are not yet ready to reveal the progress on the flight deck, but âitâll be worth the wait.â Thereâs no release date yet, but they hope to have it out by the fourth quarter of this year. They also hint that their V2 gives them a solid foundation for the 737MAX development since the visuals would meet the expected standards.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations recently released version 1.0 of their Accu-Sim Aerostar 600 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, marking the end of its early access cycle. Furthermore, they have also delineated their plans, including a version for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Update v1.0 adds the Collins ANS-351 RNAV unit, engine electric heaters, addresses bugs, animation improvements, and much more. The complete changelog follows below: - Added Collins ANS-351 RNAV unit - Added engine electric heaters - Cabin fresh air lever tooltip fixed - Fixed VOR2 TO/FROM flags - Fixed propeller rotation angle for LOD01+ - Fixed rare freeze when switching EDM modes - Fixes to the oil on the dipstick - Mapped fuel selectors to MSFS bindings (FUEL SELECTOR 1 OFF/LEFT MAIN/CROSSFEED, FEUL SELECTOR 2 OFF/RIGHT MAIN/CROSSFEED) - Smoother oil, fuel caps and doors animation - Tuned elevator authority - [Tablet] Checklist correction - [Tablet] Options rearranged - Autopilot NAV mode does not disengage on signal loss - Fixed bug with icing causing higher rumbling and shaking than it should A2A has also shared their post-release work list for the Aerostar, which is comprised of:Â  Due to popular demand, A2A has also decided to backport the Aerostar to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, albeit with some limitations: no walkaround and no dynamic wear/dirt visuals. Other than that, it will include the full Accu-Sim fidelity and systems depth. It will be included for free with the MSFS 2024 product download for all existing customers, and development is already underway. They might use a light early access model for this version, similar to what they did with the MSFS 2024 version. Other plans include a livery pack for Xbox pilots and - maybe - a second Comanche Livery pack. Once the Aerostar is deemed complete, they will move on to their next aircraft. They hinted that they have never modeled it before for other platforms, meaning itâs a brand new project. The add-on is available on their website for $49.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Boris Audio Works recently announced the development and imminent release of a sound pack for PMDG's 777 lineupâencompassing every engine variant (GE, PW, and RR)âin collaboration with Dave from Fenix Simulations.Â  In a seven-minute video, Boris previews some of the new sounds, including start-up, cabin &amp; flight deck sounds, buttons, and more. A more in-depth showcase will be out soon. Curiously enough, PMDG has recently claimed (in a development update) to be nearly completing their sound upgrade for the 777 lineup, but it won't encompass every engine variant. While there's no release date yet (although it's said to be coming this month), Boris has announced a $15 price tag for the whole bundle or $8 per engine pack.

    <title>RkApps Announces FSRealistic+ for MSFS 2020</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. RkApps recently announced FSRealistic+ for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 (the latter will depend on ChasePlane's eventual compatibility), rebuilt from the ground up to ensure the utmost realism, bringing new effects, a significant sound redesign, and realistic camera motions by integrating with Parallel 42's ChasePlane. Combining FSRealistic+'s most advanced camera and sound effects with ChasePlane's powerful camera engine, the plugin delivers "realism like never before", enhancing every phase of flight. â Among the effects, engine vibration now translates into natural cockpit motion, rattling and vibrating as it would in real life; Applying reverse thrust now makes the camera react accordingly. Furthermore, passengers can now react to adverse conditions such as pronounced turbulence and rough landings.Â  â Users can create and share custom sound profiles straightforwardly, fostering creativity and potentially improving the app's longevity. â Due to how much FSRealistic+ depends on ChasePlane for the realistic camera effects to work, the latter is a requirement. Users who don't own ChasePlane might have to settle with FSRealistic Pro instead, a cheaper - and less feature-rich - solution. â The product is already in an advanced stage of development, and it will launch once the developers deem it ready. Pricing is yet to be defined, but FSRealistic Pro owners will be eligible for a discount. Threshold will keep you covered!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. TaiModels has just released their rendition of Kempegowda International Airport (BLR/VOBL) for X-Plane 12, MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024. Located 35km (22mi) from the city, it serves Bengaluru and is the third busiest airport in India, with over 41 million passenger operations in 2024. Opened in May 2008, replacing the old HAL Airport. Originally, the airport had a single runway, accompanied by a terminal with 8 jetbridges, one double-arm jetbridge, and 9 remote parking stands. In February 2009, the airport was renamed in honour of the founder of the city, Kempe Gowda I.Â  The first airport expansion was launched in 2011 and finished two years later. The passenger terminal size has been doubled, with additional check-in desks, immigration, and baggage-reclaim facilities. A single domestic gate and 3 international gates were also added.Â  The latest airport expansion was completed in 2021, where the airport received another runway and a second terminal, allowing it to handle between 55 and 60 million passengers annually. The TaiModelsâ rendition of the Kempegowda Intlâ features handcrafted PBR ground textures and markings, detailed terminal interior, accurate airport lighting and custom-made night lighting, optimised performance, tower laser effects, and animated screens and escalators. The scenery is available for purchase on the iniBuilds store for approximately $21.91, requiring at least 1.82GB of free disk space.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Got Friends has released a broad compatibility update, covering 23 freeware and payware projects, bringing its line-up forward for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.Â  Work has been done across environmental sounds, animations, broader code, and long-requested quality-of-life fixes have been implemented. Two legacy items remain pending: the 40th Anniversary Pack and the Avatar Collections, which are not yet compatible. Alongside the updates, Got Friends says its next aircraft, the Aeroprakt A32 Vixxen, has now entered beta. The project is being developed with Aeroprakt USA and Heavenbound Aviation in Johnstown, Ohio.Â  The flight school has built a custom panel with RealSimGear avionics, tied to an MSFS 2024 build for training use. Accompanying the aircraftâs release will be a small scenery rendition of the school's 5OI8 Mcknight Airport. The A32 Vixxen will include numerous variants and options, including steam and analogue instrument layouts, AirTrac tyres, with wheelpants for paved operations, and Tundra tyres for bush flying. Pricing has not been finalised, though the team indicates it will be in line with previous releases. Got Friends is targeting a near-term launch for both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The FlightSimWeekend Foundation has officially announced that registration for commercial exhibitors at FlightSimWeekend 2026 is now open. The annual event will be held at the Aviodrome Aviation Museum in Lelystad, Netherlands, from March 20th to 22nd. In addition to the opening of registrations, the team has shared several new details about the upcoming event. The team announced that FlightSimWeekend 2026 will introduce a new expansion hall, larger booth formats, and a variety of exhibitors from around the globe. Niels Voogd, the Chairman of FlightSimWeekend, stated that after gathering feedback from both exhibitors and visitors at recent events, the team decided to increase capacity and further enhance the quality of presentations. Jannes van Gestel, the Finance &amp; Operations Lead, added, âThis expansion represents a new chapter for FlightSimWeekend.â As the community continues to grow rapidly, the team aims to provide everyoneâwhether hobbyists or industry leadersâthe space they deserve. Magnus Lorvik, Senior Accounts &amp; Projects Manager, concluded by mentioning that the new hall will allow for even more engaging content for visitors to explore. For the 2026 event, Navigraph, Honeycomb Aeronautical, and iniBuilds will serve as the primary partners. These companies are returning to enhance the event with expanded exhibits and exclusive showcases in the new exhibition zones. The team emphasises that these partners have played a crucial role in the event's success. Additionally, the event will welcome new major partners for the first time, including one of the most recognisable names in the flight simulation industry. In the coming weeks, the team will provide more details as additional exhibitors and partners are confirmed. â Exhibitors interested in learning more about opportunities at the event can find a brochure here, and registration is available here. Please note that exhibitor registration is open only to commercial parties. Non-profit communities and organisations will be able to register next month, in November, using a separate form. The FlightSimWeekend Captainâs Dinner will be returning this year, alongside the second edition of the Flight Sim Awards. Last year marked the inaugural Flight Sim Awards, which honoured various developers and their contributions to the flight simulation community in partnership with FSElite, Threshold, and Cruiselevel. This event is scheduled for Friday, March 20th, at the Van der Valk Hotel Lelystad. â In addition to the Captainâs Dinner and the Flight Sim Awards, the team has announced a new social event called the FlightSimWeekend After Dark Party. This event will also take place at the Van der Valk Hotel Lelystad and aims to bring together exhibitors, partners, and the public for networking and celebration in a relaxed and festive atmosphere. Tickets for both events will be made available to the general public at a later date. FlightSimWeekend 2026 will introduce several changes and improvements to enhance the visitor experience. The event will feature increased floor space with a redesigned layout to reduce crowding and improve flow. Full-scale rigs, multi-station demos, and centrepiece installations will occupy a larger area at the event. Developers from around the world will be in attendance, and alongside commercial exhibitors, freeware projects, global networks, and grassroots clubs will play a significant role. â For exhibitors and partners, the event will include standardised modular booths as well as a limited number of large plaza booths. Professional system walls and fascia signage will provide a clean, organised look throughout the venue. As always, the environment will be welcoming to everyone, from major brands to community projects. If you're interested in learning more about the history, current status, and future of the event, be sure to read Magnus's comprehensive article. For information about the upcoming event, including travel arrangements, logistics, and other details, please visit the FlightSimWeekend website. FlightSimWeekend 2026 will be held at the Aviodrome Aviation Museum from March 20th to March 22nd.
