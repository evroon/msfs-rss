    <summary>Sim: FS24. SamScene3D has recently released their rendition of Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport (ZSQD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Qingdao with a yearly average of 21.4 million passengers. It was built to replace Qingdaoâs former main airport, Qingdao Liuting International (same ICAO). The project was approved in 2013, and construction started in 2017. By 2020, the terminal building had already passed completion acceptance, greenlighting it for a 2021 inauguration. It features a single 478,000-square-meter terminal built to handle up to 35 million passengers a year, designed in a starfish shape with five concourses, and two 3,600-meter-long runways able to handle up to an A380. Itâs a hub for Qingdao Airlines and Shandong Airlines and a focus city for Beijing Capital Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. 9 Air, Air Busan, Air China, Air Macau, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China United, Donghai Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Jeju Air, Korean Air, Scoot, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, Tibet Airlines, West Air, and XiamenAir also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed terminals, detailed ground markings, custom jetways, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $18.09, requiring at least 3.90 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>FSLabs Releases A321ceo Update Including MSFS 2024 Compatibility</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fsl302"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6768de3df1ae2d10ada9d7bc_labsup2.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently released a new update to its A321ceo product line, available via its Public and Experimental branches on the FSL Control Center. The update adds initial compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, many system enhancements, sound upgrades, and more. Update v11.0.1.302 is their first update to feature initial compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It makes several changes under the hood to support the new environment while also retaining compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The new update also brings system-level improvements, including bug fixes, performance optimizations, and refinements to raise the realism bar and reliability. They were driven by extensive internal QA and feedback from their community of pilots and testers. â The sounds were also upgraded, substantially improving the soundscape around the cockpit and engines. â Furthermore, FSLabs has also added the ROPS (Runway Overrun Prevention System)ânot to be mistaken with the thing missing from some RTX 5080s and 5090sâan advanced safety feature designed by Airbus to help mitigate the risk of runway excursions during landing. It integrates two core functions: ROW (Runway Overrun Warning) and ROP (Runway Overrun Protection). The Runway Overrun Warning provides proactive in-flight alerts by continuously computing the aircraftâs predicted stopping distances on dry and wet runways, considering real-time factors such as weight, speed, configuration, wind conditions, and runway slope. If it determines the available runway length is not enough for a safe landing, it automatically issues visual and aural alerts: â The visual alert has the PFD display ârunway too short,â the navigation display indicates the predicted stopping points extending beyond the runwayâs end. The aural alert, on the other hand, triggers below 200 feet, with a repetitive ârunway too shortâ audio warning. â The alerts are in place to prompt the crew to start a go-around procedure, as a landing attempt beyond that point is deemed completely unsafe. â The ROP system takes over upon touchdown and continuously assesses the aircraftâs deceleration capability against the remaining runway length, providing immediate guidance may it detect insufficient stopping distance: â A visual alert â similar to the ROW one âdisplaying a ârunway too shortâ warning, and aural alerts issuing commands such as âbrake max braking,â âset max reverse,â and âkeep max reverseâ depending on the situation at hand, ensuring maximum deceleration efforts. â The feature was faithfully recreated to replicate Airbus logic, ensuring realism and immersion for the virtual pilot. â The Flight Performance Model has also been tweaked, changing how it responds in roll. By closely analyzing the roll momentum and inertia characteristics of the real A321 and incorporating feedback from current Airbus-rated pilots, they have fine-tuned the control laws within the ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer). It involved reworking gain schedules and dynamic response parameters to replicate the planeâs roll behavior more accurately across different flight phases and load conditions.  â Furthermore, the update now makes livery-specific EFB Backgrounds a possibility, no longer relying on Airline packs for that. â The complete changelog for the update follows below: Simulator Platform Air Con APU ATSU/AOC CPC Effects EFIS/FCU Engines FAC Flaps FMGC Flight Guidance/ELAC/FM LGCIU/BSCU Fault logic fixed ROPS Sounds Techlog XPDR Others â FSLabs has also briefly teased their upcoming A321neo with a single screenshot of an easyJet livery. The FSLabs A321ceo is available in their store for $69.95. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently released their new rendition of Brisbane International Airport (YBBN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves South East Queensland and has a yearly average of 22.2 million passengers, making it the third busiest airport in Australia. It was built to replace Eagle Farm Airport, Brisbane's first airport - only 5 km away from the new airport's location - deemed inadequate by the 1960s standards for how big Brisbane was, eventually leading to the idea of constructing a brand new airport beside it, which started in 1980 and only saw its conclusion in 1988, with a domestic terminal and two runways. The international terminal only came to be in 1995 and has been progressively expanded. In 2007, the government approved the construction of a new parallel runway, which was expected to take eight years to build on swamp land 2 kilometers west of the terminal area. The unexpectedly long construction time was due to the settling period of the 13,000,000 cubic meters of sand gathered from Moreton Bay to cover the swamp. Work was completed in 2020, costing $1 billion and taking precisely eight years from start to finish. It's a hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia. Air Canada, Air Niugini, Alliance Airlines, American Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, EVA Air, Fiji Airways, FlyPelican, Jetstar, Korean Air, Link Airways, National Jet Express, Nauru Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, QantasLink, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Skytrans Airlines, Solomon Airlines, United Airlines, VietJet Air, and Virgin Australia also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, high-resolution orthoimagery, updated ground polygons, realistic night lighting, enhanced airside clutter, and an animated monorail. It's available on OrbxDirect (2020/2024) for roughly $16.90, requiring at least 7.71 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently released their rendition of Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport (KPVD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which serves Providence with a yearly average of 4 million passengers. It was dedicated in 1931 as Hillsgrove State Airport, and its first passenger terminal was only built in 1933. Its original layout consisted of three 910-meter-long concrete runways. It was used for flight training by the United States Army Air Force during 1942 and 1945, hosting the 435th Army Air Force Base. The WW2 occupation period led to several upgrades, including runway extensions (300 meters each) and slightly improved infrastructure. In the 1960s, a new terminal was built, as the old one was not large enough to handle a metropolitan area with over a million people.Â  It wasnât until 1996 that it would see another upgrade, entirely replaced by a new passenger terminal with 18 gates. Four extra gates were added in 1997. Itâs a hub for Wiggins Airways and an operating base for Breeze Airways. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, BermudAir, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a true-to-life landside, realistic dynamic lighting, custom jetways, real-world signage, LOD-optimized objects, and much more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $13.51 (introductory price), requiring at least 3.77 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>V Pilot Designs Releases El Dorado International Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. V Pilot Designs has recently released their rendition of El Dorado International Airport (SKBO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving BogotÃ¡ and its surrounding areas with a yearly average of 45.8 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in Latin America. The airport was conceived during General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla's government as part of his intent to modernize Colombia. Construction started in 1955, and it opened its doors for passengers within four years. It ultimately replaced Techo International Airport, Bogota's former main airport. By 1973, the airport was already handling over 3 million passengers, leading to concerns about over-congestion in the near future, which led to plans for a new runway. The second runway only came to be in 1998, much to the dismay of the locals, as that meant more noise. In 2017, the airport's Terminal 1 was significantly expanded, going from 173,000 square meters to 235,000, and can now handle up to 43 million passengers annually. Two years ago, plans were made to expand the airport further, bringing its capacity up to 60 million passengers annually. The project, funnily enough, was named El Dorado Max. It's a hub for Aerosucre, Avianca, Avianca Cargo, Avianca Express, Copa Airlines Colombia, LATAM Colombia, LATAM Cargo Colombia, and SATENA, and an operating base for AerCaribe, Central Charter de Colombia, Clic Air, Helicol, SADELCA, SAEP, and Wingo. Aerolineas Argentinas, AeromÃ©xico, Air Canada, Air Europa, Air France, American Airlines, Arajet, Avior Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta, Emirates, Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, Iberia, JetSmart, KLM, Lufthansa, Spirit, Turkish, United, Viva, and Volaris also serve it. The scenery was rebuilt from scratch for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, featuring an up-to-date ground layout, high-resolution PBR textures, performance-friendly optimization, highly detailed terminals, custom jetways, and much more. It's available in the MSFS 2024 Marketplace for $21.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Cardinal Horizon Relaunches SimVector With New Data Platform</title>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Cardinal Horizon has recently released SimVector, a subscription-based platform designed to provide affordable, dynamic schedule data for the flight simulation community. â First launched in 2019 as a live VATSIM map, SimVector has been reworked to address the growing need for up-to-date airline schedules. Today, many virtual airlines rely on static spreadsheets, which are prone to falling behind real-world changes, such as new routes or equipment swaps. â âFor many months, the communities that use our products have complained about stagnation in the market, data quality, and more with existing schedule offeringsâ, said Taylor Broad, owner of Cardinal Horizon. âSimVector is our answer. We want to provide data and products that allow our customers and their staff to focus on building communities, and not the minutiae of maintaining these datasets on their own.â The platform's standout feature is SimVector Direct Delivery, available on the Plus plan, allowing purchased data to be synced directly with a userâs phpVMS v7 installation. This removes the need for manual downloads or uploads, keeping schedule data current with minimal user intervention. â Data is formatted for phpVMS v7, and available in CSV and JSON formats. Pricing follows a points-based model, where the number of points required per airline is proportional to the cost of acquiring the data. This results in notable cost savings compared to traditional providers. For example, a dataset for Delta Air Lines costs $4.32 under the Plus plan, versus $20.31 on a competing platform. â The Basic plan includes 50 points for $10 per month, while the Plus plan offers 250 points for $29 per month and unlocks Direct Delivery.Â  A general aviation apron model is also provided, with potential for more features as development progresses. â Although the platform currently focuses on flight schedules, Cardinal Horizon has confirmed the development of additional datasets in the future. â You can learn more by visiting simvector.net. â For more updates on SimVector and the latest in flight simulation, keep an eye on Threshold. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has recently issued an experimental compatibility patch to their 737 Max for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with an addendum that there are still issues with it, hence the âexperimentalâ tag. âThe changes introduced by Asobo have been difficult for developers to deal with, and we want to say up front there are remaining issues due to the base sim still being work-in-progress by Asobo,â warns iFly. They also add that people are welcome to try it if they want, but itâs an experimental release, if anything. They complement, âThere are still multiple, unresolved compatibility issues remaining. Any future progress by us depends on Asobo supplying the complete backward compatibility they promised.âÂ  iFly believes that despite the many issues, itâs already possible to fly from A to B with their 737 Max and have fun. Some features, such as the airport maps and RAAS, do not work due to the way everything is now streamed, but these options will be made available again at a later date. Running iFly Manager 1.0.4.0+ is required to install the update, which appears once you select âMSFS 2024â within it. â The add-on is available on their store for $69.95, requiring at least 5 GB of hard disk space to install.

Aerolineas Argentinas, AeromÃ©xico, Air Canada, Air Europa, Air France, American Airlines, Arajet, Avior Airlines, Copa Airlines, Delta, Emirates, Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, Iberia, JetSmart, KLM, Lufthansa, Spirit, Turkish, United, Viva, and Volaris also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, custom jetways, rebuilt interiors for MSFS 2024, and much more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $8.00, requiring at least 1.08 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Propair Releases Rocky Mountain Airport for MSFS 2020</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Propair has recently released their rendition of Rocky Mountain Airport (KBJC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, serving Denver, Colorado, with a yearly average of 262,000 aircraft movements. The airportâs history stretches back to the late 1950s, when the increased demand for private air travel required something beyond Stapleton International Airport (Denverâs former main airport), as that one was operating at capacity. The idea was to create an airport dedicated to general aviation, offering a convenient alternative for private aircraft, corporate jets, and flight training operations that were increasingly constrained at a large hub such as Stapleton. The airport has experienced exponential growth through the 1960s and 1970s, thanks to the rise of corporate aviation. Its strategic location close to Denver and Boulder made it extremely attractive and way easier to access than Stapleton ever could. In 1995, with Stapletonâs closure, Rocky Mountain Airport (then Jefferson County Airport) rode their first high wave, as Denver International Airport had no intent whatsoever to be general aviation friendly, meaning JeffCo would take all of the GA traffic that was once meant for Stapleton. Many investments were made during that period to ensure the infrastructure was always up to the highest standard. In the early 2000s, the airportâs administration decided to be more than just a general aviation airport and embrace regional tourism, changing their name to âRocky Mountain Metropolitan Airportâ and solidifying its role as the gateway to the Rocky Mountains.Â  JSX currently serves it, with flights to Burbank, DallasâLove Field, Las Vegas, and Scottsdale. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR materials, custom night lighting, custom ground poly, animated people, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.14, requiring at least 2.66 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDG Releases 777-300ER for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently made their Boeing 777-300ER compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the last remaining member of their 777 lineup that was still only available in MSFS 2020. Furthermore, they have also updated the 777-200ER and the 777F for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 with build 113, bringing version parity across the entire aircraft family. Regarding the Marketplace debut, PMDG doesnât know when the 777 updates will arrive in MSFS 2020 nor when the planes will appear for purchase in 2024âs marketplace, as they are still working through some data sent by the Microsoft team overlooking the intake process. The instruction sets provided by Microsoft conflict with PMDGâs method of doing things, and they are working out a way to settle that properly. The 777-200LR is set to enter beta testing this weekend, and they plan to release it by the end of the month. PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
