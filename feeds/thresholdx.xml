    <summary>Sim: FS24. Synaptic Simulations has shared a brief end-of-year development update on its upcoming A220, offering a snapshot of where the project stands as it heads into 2026. Over the past year, the team has made steady progress across the aircraftâs core systems, including engine control, fly-by-wire, and autoflight logic, as well as a significant rebuild of the flight management system, to support deeper system integration.Â  System complexity has continued to grow, with the EICAS now featuring more than 100 messages. At the same time, ongoing revisions to both the engine and flight models aim to further refine the aircraftâs handling and performance.Â  Looking ahead, Synaptic says testing will ramp up in the coming months, with a focus on LNAV behaviour across global procedures, VNAV integration, and ensuring that performance data is adequately respected by guidance and engine systems. A handful of remaining systems, including pressurisation and autobrakes, are still being finalised.Â  While the A220 did not release in 2025, the team reiterated that the extra time is being used to deliver a more complete, polished product, with further updates expected, as development continues into the new year.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The community survey for the Flightsim Awards 2026 is now live, marking the opening of the official nomination phase for next yearâs awards.Â  The survey allows simmers to nominate projects, developers, creators, and long-term contributors they believe made a meaningful impact on the flight simulation scene in 2025. The nomination phase plays a key role in shaping the final shortlist, covering a wide range of categories across aircraft, scenery, tools, freeware, hardware, innovation, and community contributions.Â  Participants are free to nominate in as many or as few categories as they wish, with no requirement to complete the entire form. All submissions will be reviewed and passed on to the Flightsim Awards organising board and jury, alongside nominations gathered from invited content creators and media outlets. The goal is to ensure that the final voting slate reflects a broad community sentiment, rather than a curated selection. All entries are evaluated according to shared principles: The survey is being distributed jointly by Threshold, FSElite, and Cruiselevel, who together organise the Flight Sim Awards. Public voting will follow later in the process, with a jury step only used in cases of ties or irregular results. Nominations are open until the published deadline, with eligibility limited to products and projects released or significantly updated in 2025.Â  The winners will be revealed during the Captainâs Dinner at FlightSimWeekend 2026, on Friday, March 20.  â Take the nomination survey here.  You can read more on the Flight Sim Awards website. Tickets to FlightSimWeekend 2026 and the Captain's Dinner can be found here. â Join the Flight Sim Awards Discord and be a part of the Awards community!

    <title>FSoares Shares New GaleÃ£o International Airport Previews </title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSoares has recently teased the development progress on his Rio de Janeiro/GaleÃ£o International Airport (SBGL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This is the main airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a yearly average of 14.5 million passengers. It was opened in 1952 on top of a pre-existing Brazilian Air Force base that was utilized by international long-haul flights, which were too heavy and too large for SBRJâs (Rioâs domestic airport) 1,300 m runway. With the ever-increasing international demand, they finally built a passenger terminal, which was progressively expanded until 1977. A new terminal building was opened that year, and all scheduled passenger traffic was transferred there. Itâs still in use today as Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was first renovated in 1991 in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit (held in 1992), and its annual capacity increased to 7.5 million passengers. Eight years later, Terminal 2 was opened, featuring 24 jetways and a capacity of up to 7.5 million passengers per year. âWith the imminence of the World Cup and the Olympic Games in 2014 and 2016, respectively, Infraero (the airportâs former manager) unveiled a $431 million upgrade and expansion plan for GaleÃ£o, including the renovation of Terminal 1, the completion of Terminal 2, and the expansion of the parking lots. The new concessionary revised the plans and included a new pier with 26 jetways, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2640 parking spaces. The $400 million sum quickly jumped to $800 million instead. AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, Azul, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Flybondi, Gol, Iberia, ITA Airways, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, KLM, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Latam PerÃº, Lufthansa, Paranair, Sky Airlines, TAP, and United Airlines serve it. There is no information on features, pricing, or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. XWind Studios has recently announced the development of Long Beach Airport (KLGB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Greater Los Angeles with a yearly average of 4.1 million passengers. The airport was built on the same site as the worldâs first flight school (created in 1919 by Earl S. Daugherty), after he managed to convince the city council to transform the structure into a municipal airport in 1923. The passenger terminal building was built in 1941, designed by William Horace Austin and Kenneth Smith Wing.  During its first few decades of commercial operations, the only destinations were Los Angeles, San Diego, and Catalina Island. It wasnât until 1962 that the route network expanded to San Francisco, and eventually to Las Vegas and Oakland, with the advent of jet aircraft in the late 1960s. The early 1990s were disastrous for the airportâs traffic figures, with multiple airlines ending service to it. Further blows came in the early 2000s and mid-2010s, when American Airlines and Alaska Airlines ceased service, respectively. Itâs served by Delta Airlines, Delta Connection, Hawaiian Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. â The developers claim to have spent the last nine months learning, researching, and working their way through the production of the scenery, which is approximately 70% complete and is expected to be released within the first quarter of the year. âIf you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

Drzewiecki Design has recently released their freeware rendition of Warsaw-Radom Airport (EPRA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Radom, Poland, with an average of 112,610 passengers per year. It was built in early 1929 as a training facility for Polandâs first civilian pilot training school, and was eventually handed over to the military in 1932, which greatly expanded the facility by buying additional land and building hangars, barracks, and a shooting range. It then became a training facility for military pilots and paratroopers. As soon as World War 2 started, the base was heavily damaged by bombings, completely destroying the aircraft based there, some of the hangars, and forcing the crew to evacuate. The Germans took over the airport and used it to train and prepare their pilots for combat on the Eastern Front.  By the end of the conflict, the airport was once again heavily damaged and mined, requiring extra effort from the Polish Army to get it back into shape, which they have done rather promptly. They have been conducting pilot training sessions continuously since mid-1945. In mid-2006, Radomâs municipal administration established Port Lotniczy Radom S.A., with a hefty budget, to operate as a civilian airport. It wasnât until the early 2010s that the necessary work was carried out to prepare the airport for such a task, though. In 2012, they bought Lodzâ airport's former terminal (disassembled) and reassembled it the following year, completing it a year later.  AirBaltic and Czech Airlines were the first to embrace the new airport with scheduled services, albeit quickly giving up after yielding suboptimal traffic numbers.  In the late 2010s, the administration decided to repurpose Radom as a low-cost airport, which initially drew strong opposition, especially given that the region already had two major airports (Modlin and Chopin).  The new terminal building was completed in 2022 and inaugurated in mid-2023. â Itâs served by Enter Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Mavi GÃ¶k Airlines, and Wizz Air. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom 3D models, custom ground service equipment, performance-friendly optimization, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. â Itâs available for free on Contrail, requiring at least 2.41 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has published a comprehensive set of newsletters, detailing whatâs ahead for DCS World in 2026 and beyond, combining a forward-looking technical roadmap with a look back at recent campaign releases and whatâs still to come. At the core of the 2026 plans is continued work on the long-awaited Dynamic Campaign, with development now heavily focused on strategic and tactical AI behaviour, ground force interactions, and the supporting user interface.  Eagle Dynamics says internal testing is already underway, across multiple maps and force compositions, with tools planned to allow players to interact with Air Tasking Orders, objectives, and mission data in far more depth than before. Another major pillar is the transition to the Vulkan API, described as being in late-stage development. The move is expected to unlock modern rendering features, such as improved frame generation support, expanded DLSS and FSR options, cockpit ray tracing, and better VRAM management.  Alongside this, further performance work, visual effects upgrades, and expanded multi-threading on the simulation side remain in progress. Beyond core engine work, Eagle Dynamics highlighted improvements to weather, explosions, and visual effects, a new navmesh system for better AI ground pathfinding, and a complete overhaul of ATC and radio communications. Mission State Save, introduced in 2025, will also continue to expand, with additional waypoint and AI behaviour data planned to be preserved between sessions. On the content side, 2026 will see continued support for existing aircraft and maps, completion of the Afghanistan and Iraq terrains, and progress on new modules, including the free Flaming Cliffs-level Su-25, alongside longer-term projects, such as the F-15C and F-35A.  The Pacific Theatre of Operations remains a major focus, with the F6F Hellcat, A6M5 Zero, a dedicated WWII Marianas map, and a large PTO assets pack, all forming the foundation for 1944-era operations. Eagle Dynamics also published an extensive campaign retrospective for 2025, highlighting a strong year for single-player content across multiple eras and aircraft, from WWII to modern combat. Looking ahead, a wide range of new training, historical, and story-driven campaigns are already in development for 2026 and beyond, as the ecosystem of third-party campaign creators continues to grow.  Further details are expected in upcoming updates. You can read Part 1 of the roadmap here, Part 2 here, and the Campaign Retrospective here.  As always, weâll keep you updated. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
