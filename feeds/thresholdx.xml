    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently launched its version of Oulu Airport (EFOU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport, located approximately 6.6 miles from the city center of Oulu, Finland, welcomes around 550.000 passengers each year and handles nearly 6.000 aircraft movements. The airport opened in 1953, following the commencement of construction in 1949. Initially, the airport featured only gravel runways. This changed in 1958 when the runways were paved, and the airport received its terminal and air traffic control (ATC) building. In 1973, the current terminal building replaced the earlier structure, which was later demolished in 2005. The terminal underwent further expansion and renovation in 2002 and 2011. Regarding the runways, the second runway was removed in 2000, shortly after the completion of the current ATC tower in 1998. Today, the airport operates flights from Finnair, Lufthansa, and Aegean Airlines, offering various regular and charter destinations, including Helsinki, Munich, Chania, and Rhodes. The scenery package is filled with features including custom night lighting, custom parking positions, custom surroundings, custom people, PBR materials, and much more. The add-on requires slightly over 1 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for $17.16. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Plane 12.1.3 has just been fully released, one and a half months after the first beta release. ATC, the user interface, and sounds are among the most improved aspects of this update. â ATC and sounds According to Laminar Research, the ATC system has undergone a significant overhaul. Radio communications have become much more realistic, including features such as radio checks, clearance requests, and VFR and IFR procedures that support SIDs and STARs. Additionally, the default navigation data has been updated to AIRAC 2306. Users can now copy and paste routes from tools like Navigraph and Simbrief directly into their flight plans. They can also request alternative SIDs and STARs, ask for altitude exceptions, and receive per-turn instructions. Furthermore, X-Plane can now be configured to output ATC audio to a separate audio device. Weather A full weather update is planned, but some changes have been made in version 12.1.3. Issues with sudden altitude and pressure changes during mid flight have been resolved. Additionally, improvements have been made to cloud visualization and interpreting METAR information and wind data. Errors related to the NEXRAD display for document number G1000 have also been addressed. User interface The flight configuration menu now provides more detailed information about gates and ramps. Additionally, the map highlights active runways and shows taxi routes. Several smaller improvements have also been made, including fixing rendering stutters that occurred when displaying UI elements and ensuring that VR windows maintain their positions. X-Plane identity In preparation for the X-Plane Store, the X-Plane identity feature has been released in early access. This feature allows you to link your purchase key to your X-Plane identity. Once you complete the migration, your X-Plane key will no longer be necessary; a simple login will grant you access to the simulator. In the future, purchases from the X-Plane Store will be linked to your X-Plane identity. According to Laminar Research, migrating to X-Plane identity is entirely optional. Several other changes have been implemented, including a handcrafted overhaul of The Downtown Manhattan Heliport (KJRB) and enhancements to the default A330, Cirrus SR22, and Cessna Citation X. â The full list of changes can be found on X-Plane.com. â Version 12.1.4, âThe Flightlessons Updateâ is next up. â For more on that, and more, stay tuned to Threshold.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Brazil Land Games has recently released its rendition of FlorianÃ³polis âHercÃ­lio Luz International Airport (SBFL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (MSFS 2024 compatible). The airport serves FlorianÃ³polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 3.9 million passengers. It was initially built in the late 1920s as Campeche Field, and the French aviators of the Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale AÃ©ropostale used it for their operations to and from FlorianÃ³polis. In the 1940s, a proper runway and basic infrastructure (apron, control tower, and passenger terminal) were built. As the airport was shared with the Brazilian Air Force, some military infrastructure improvements were also made. The passenger terminal was rebuilt and modernized in the early 1950s and remained in use until the 1970s when a brand-new terminal was opened. The terminal was then expanded in the late 1980s and in 2000, reaching a total area of 8,700 square meters.Â  In early 2017, Flughafen Zurich AG won a concession to operate and expand the airport, which kicked off shortly after in 2018. This included the construction of a new terminal with fourteen new gates, costing 570 million BRL. At the time, the main runway was also extended by 100 meters. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Flybondi, Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Chile, Paranair, Sky Airline, Sky Airline Peru, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, custom landside buildings, a custom terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on their website for roughly $8. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Based on the also successful DA20, Diamond Aircraft Industries designed a four-seat prototype, named DA40 Diamond Star.Â  The COWS DA40 is based on the XLS version. Considered as a âdeluxeâ version,Â it features a G1000 glass cockpit with WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) capability, Garmin GDL69 datalink, and a TAS traffic alert system.Â  Their rendition will feature custom-designed systems with interactive circuit breakers, EIS, and custom cylinder simulation. While the price and the release date for X-Plane 12 are still undisclosed, the developers have mentioned that they are targeting the release of FS20 and FS24 in early 2025.Â  As always, Threshold will keep you updated with any news and updates about the COWS DA40-XLS! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds has released another teaser for their upcoming A350, showcasing the liveries that will be included at launch through a video shared on their social media. The video showcases six liveries belonging to airlines from around the world: Delta, Japan Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Lufthansa, and Emirates. This is in addition to Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and British Airways, which have also been teased previously. Highly anticipated, the iniBuilds A350 aims to become the first study-level A350 in Microsoft Flight Simulator. According to iniBuilds, the aircraft will feature detailed 3D cabins, a comprehensive flight attendant panel, custom terrain radar, and intricate system simulation. It also includes Navigraph integration, SimBrief import, complex maintenance simulation, and a multitude of failures and emergency situations. â The aircraft was originally scheduled for release in 2024, but its launch has been postponed to 2025 to ensure a "fantastic product at launch." Additionally, the aircraft will be available for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and 2020, despite it being initially planned as an exclusive for the 2024 version. IniBuilds cited stability issues with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 as the reason for this decision. Stay tuned to Threshold for additional updates on the iniBuilds A350, and more.

    <title>Headwind Simulations Previews Custom Cockpit for Airbus A339X</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Freeware developer Headwind Simulations has recently showcased a preview of the upcoming custom cockpit for its A339X project, in a video posted on the AviatorCro YouTube channel. Until now, the aircraft has had a cockpit based on the FlyByWire A32NX [...] According to Headwind, the footage presented does not feature a completely new model or a full A330 cockpit; however, it represents a significant improvement in quality. Several changes are immediately apparent, with the design and geometry of the main panel standing out as the most notable. It is no longer a "hybrid" between an A320 and an A330. Additionally, a third Multi-Function Control Display Unit (MCDU) has been added, and lighting controls have been fully integrated. Some systems have also been improved, such as adding the "north reference" feature, which allows for switching navigational reference from magnetic to true north. This update is Phase 1 and will not include a redesigned overhead panel, as that will be part of Phase 2. Headwind Simulations has also indicated that Phase 2 will be released once the necessary systems are in place.Â  The update is scheduled for release in January 2025 and will be exclusive to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 for the time being. â For additional updates on the Headwind Simulations A339X, and more, stay tuned to Threshold.Â  Additionally, join our vibrant community on Discord!</summary>
