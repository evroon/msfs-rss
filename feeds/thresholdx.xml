    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of Frankfurt Airport (EDDF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is Germanyâs busiest airport, with a yearly average of 59 million passengers. Inaugurated in mid-1936, Frankfurt quickly became a central distribution point for airmail transport to North America, and its passenger figures were not too shabby: It carried over 58,000 people during its first year of operation!Â  It was transferred to the Luftwaffe during World War 2, which led to the dismantling of the famous airships and their hangars. Then, the runway was fully converted into a military airfield. Four years later, Allied bombings destroyed it. Shortly after the war, the US Army took over the airport and built a new main runway and a base (Rhein-Main base).Â  In the early 1950s, civil air traffic slowly returned to normal: over 400,000 passengers passed through the airport in 1951. It wasnât until 1958 that Frankfurt would emerge as an international airline hub with the opening of East Terminal. Within four years, it was already too small for the figures at hand, with Frankfurt being the second busiest airport in Europe after Heathrow. In 1965, a new terminal was built to handle 30 million passengers per year, followed by a runway extension to accommodate larger aircraft. A new main terminal, known as the âCentral Terminal,â was built in 1972. It is divided into three concourses with 56 gates. At the time, it was assumed that the capacity would be sufficient for the next 30 years! Work on Terminal 2 started sooner than expected (in the early 1990s) because it turned out their Central Terminal was insufficient for the next thirty years. It opened in 1994, bringing the passenger handling capacity to 54 million passengers annually. Developed by Jo Erlend Sund, Lukas Vezyroglou, and their team, Mega Airport Frankfurt promises a highly accurate rendition of Germanyâs busiest airport. It features custom ground textures, custom jetways,Â  custom ground service equipment, terminal interiors, custom terraforming, and much more. Itâs available on the Aerosoft Shop for roughly $22.17 (excluding VAT) and requires at least 4.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>VIRPIL Shares More Yoke Previews</title>
    <updated>2024-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/virpil"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66da17c920ad1df1cecbfffd_GWtl72oXAAATpr-.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. VIRPIL, a hardware manufacturer well-known in the military flight sim community, has recently shared previews of their upcoming products. Until now, they have been mostly military-oriented, offering joystick bases and military plane grips, collective sticks, rudders, and control panels. Posted on their social media accounts, they showed a piece of hardware resembling a yoke, although a piece of cloth covered it. The following post presented more pieces of hardware that looked like they were connected to the yoke base, on the right side, one could see a knob with a switch that reminded of the Boeing-styled engine start panel.Â  The next post brought even more details, and caused more speculation. Again, a similar panel to the engine starter was present, except this time, the panel had light controls. The interesting part is that right next to the panel, a landing gear lever on an unscrewed panel. Not much information has been provided by VIRPIL, but one of the theories was that the panels are customisable and that one could set them up to their liking. The latest and the most exciting post, however, was released today. It featured two yokes, the left one shared a striking resemblance to the B737 and B747 yokes, although slightly modified, as the right side had hat switches which are most likely for view controls. The right yoke was a big surprise though, as it looked very similar to the good old bicycle yoke, commonly used on Embraer aircraft. Alongside the image of two yokes, VIRPIL posted a caption saying âPrepare for flight briefing - 06.09.2024!â Keep an eye out, as Threshold will keep you updated on the progress of VIRPIL yokes and any other big news about them. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. After a couple of days of teasers, VIRPIL has finally revealed their newest project. The 'VIRPIL Controls Advanced Flight Yoke Projectâ is their first project in the general aviation segment, with their stated goal of creating the "best yoke controller available to virtual pilots, at an attainable price." The project revealed two yokes, one of which looked like a Boeing-style yoke, while the second one looked very similar to the Embraer Phenom yoke. The VIRPIL Controls will feature metal construction, a wide range of adjustments, high-precision digital sensors, and swappable yoke handles. Alongside the yokes, VIRPIL confirmed that they will be working on a throttle unit and a lineup of panels.Â  The âAdvanced Flight Yoke Projectâ will be launched as a project on Kickstarter, starting October 1st 2024. According to VIRPIL, the target retail price will be around â¬500 ($552USD). Kickstarter supporters will also receive early-bird pricing and have exclusive access to discussions about VIRPIL's future lineups.Â  As always, Threshold will keep you updated on the progress and news about the VIRPIL Flight Yoke Project! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

    <title>Drzewiecki Design Releases Warsaw Chopin Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-09-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/warsaw"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66dca889811ee11ede54fadd_waw1.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Drzewiecki Design has recently released their rendition of Warsaw Chopin Airport (EPWA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Warsaw Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 18.5 million passengers, roughly 40% of the countryâs total air passenger traffic. Urban development in the mid-1920s led to air traffic complications around Warsawâs former aerodrome, leading to the need to build a new airport elsewhere. A decade later, a new airport was finally ready to roll, built near the village of Okecie. It featured a ticket office, customs post, police station, newspaper kiosk, restaurant, and viewing terraceâstate-of-the-art infrastructure for early 1930 standards.Â  After the civilian infrastructure was considered ready, they began developing its military potential by constructing a Polish Air Force base, an Institute of Aviation building, an aircraft-building plant, and other military-related structures. In the late 1930s, the airport was equipped with radio navigation equipment to aid pilots during low-visibility conditions.Â  World War 2 wholly destroyed the airport, which happened to be a battleground between the Germans and the Polish Resistance. It was a bombing target from day one and was occupied by the Luftwaffe as soon as Germany took the country over.Â  The Germans built their first concrete runways and taxiways, which remained undamaged until the final days of the war when they were deliberately destroyed to prevent the enemies from using them. After the war, LOT Polish Airlines resumed operations at what used to be the airport, kicking off the reconstruction efforts. In two years, they have built a new terminal, a new control tower, and many aircraft parking stands, making it ready to serve people again. The airportâs terminal was reconstructed between 1964 and 1969 after LOT transferred its maintenance rights to state administration. By 1970, it already hit the one millionth passenger mark. It made them realize that their new terminal was already too small, leading to the construction of a temporary arrival hall, and a pre-war structure was used for domestic operations. While passenger numbers slightly declined in the early 1980s, the mid-80s and beyond were the opposite, with the administration urging further expansion of the airport. The expansion plans from the late 1980s only started after the fall of communism in the early 1990s. The new terminal was finally brought to life at the cost of 300 million German marks, using 164 subcontractors and 24 months of work. With a maximum capacity of 3.5 million passengers, it could handle 3.5 more people than the previous terminal, which was more than enough at the time. A new terminal (North Hall) was built in 2008, featuring a considerably larger footprint. It now handles arrivals for Star Alliance and Oneworld Airlines. Itâs a hub for LOT Polish Airlines and a focus city for Enter Air, Smartwings Poland, SprintAir, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Air China, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, Ethiopian Airlines, Finnair, flydubai, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Qatar Airways, TAP Air Portugal, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features custom ground textures, PBR materials, performance-friendly optimization, custom jetways, custom ground service equipment, custom landside buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket or OrbxDirect for roughly $24.98/$24.00, requiring at least 1.91 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games recently released their rendition of BrasiliaâPresident Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. SBBR is the third busiest airport in Brazil, with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more. It was divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom terminal interiors, custom landside representation, accurate runway profile, and more. Itâs available in their store for roughly $10. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Digital Design has recently released their rendition of Saint Petersburg Pulkovo Airport (ULLI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving the city of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast, it had more than 18,000,000 passenger operations and more than 144,000 aircraft movements, making it the 4th busiest airport in Russia.Â  After a year and 6 months of construction, the Shosseynaya Airport (named after a nearby railway station) was opened on 6th June 1932. The first flights to this airport carried passengers and mail from Moscow. Soon after, the airport had scheduled flights to four other regional airports. During WWII, the Shosseynaya Airport was at the front line during the Siege of Leningrad. It took more than 3 years after the war for the airport to be fully repaired, and the scheduled passenger service between Moscow and Leningrad was resumed.Â  In the mid-1950s, a new extended runway was built and the airport could handle larger aircraft such as Ilyushin Il-18 and Tupolev Tu-104. The early 1960s brought AN-24 and Yak-40 to the airport, and flights to Vladivostok also started to emerge. By the late 1960s, more than 60 airlines offered flights to and from Leningrad Airport. In 1973, the airport was renamed Pulkovo Airport, and the new passenger terminals were opened. In 1990, Pulkovo reached the passenger traffic rate of over 10,000,000 passengers. Unfortunately, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the number of passengers rapidly declined.Â  In 2007, new terminal expansion projects began, and since then, the Pulkovo Airport has seen a constant rise in passenger operations (with an exception in 2020 due to COVID).Â  The Pulkovo Airport is the hub for Rossiya Airlines, Nordwind, Pobeda, Smartavia, and Ural Airlines, and a destination for over 50 airlines flying to 168 destinations across Europe, Africa and Asia.Â  Digital Designâs rendition of Pulkovo airport features highly detailed airport objects including interior terminals, custom animated GSE, custom GSX profile, customised jetways, accurate terrain and runway profiles, custom areal imagery, realistic dynamic lighting, St. Petersburg major landmarks, custom helipad at Gazprom Arena, custom animated yachts and boats near the coastline and compatibility with free St. Petersburg landmarks by SkySorceress. This scenery is available for purchase on SimMarket for roughly 21.50 $ and requires at least 4.10GB of free disk space.Â  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Canadian Flight Sim Studios has released their rendition of Kingston Norman Rogers Airport (CYGK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving Kingston (not to be confused with the Jamaican capital!) and the metropolitan area of Ontario. Located 5 miles west of downtown Ontario, it is the largest airport in the area and had 70,000 passenger operations in 2019.Â  During the WWII, an airfield near Kingston was built for training purposes. In 1942, it began serving as a training station for T-6 Texan and Fairey Battle. In 1953, a Naval Air Squadron was formed, using C-45D Expeditor (military version of Beechcraft Model 18) and T-6 Texans, operating from Kingston Airport until 1959 when the unit was disbanded.Â  In 1972, the city took control of the airport and extended two runways, while the third runway (12/30) was decommissioned and turned into a taxiway. Runway 01/19 also saw further expansion as it was extended to 6,000ft, while the terminal was expanded in order to accommodate Q-400 and B737.Â  Today, Kingston Airport is served by Air Canada, FlyGTA and Pascan Aviation, while SkyLink Express offers cargo flights between Kingston and Hamilton. Canadian Flight Sim Studios rendition of Kingston Norman Rogers Airport features custom animated objects, accurate airport layout, accurate ground texture and weather effects, enhanced night environment, dynamic lighting and weather effects and optimised performance.Â  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and high-quality reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Orbx has recently published previews of their upcoming rendition of Melbourne Airport for X-Plane 12. Serving the city of Melbourne, it had more than 30,500,000 passenger operations in 2023 and more than 215,000 aircraft movements, making it the second busiest airport in Australia. In May 1957, plans for making a new airport near Melbourne were announced. Thirteen years later, the Melbourne International Airport was opened, ending Melbourne Essendonâs 20 years of being an international airport for Melbourne. During the first year of operation, Melbourne Airport handled 155,275 passengers and six international airlines. During the late 1980s, the Australian Government formed the Federal Airport Commission and placed Melbourne Intlâ Airport under their control along with 21 other airports. The first major updates were carried out at the domestic terminals, while the other upgrade included a new three-story concourse equipped with 10 jet bridges.Â  However, in 1994, all FAC-operated airports would be privatised in several phases. This included Melbourne International Airport as well and since then, it has been under the control of Australia Pacific Airports Corporation. Since the privatisation, further improvements to the infrastructure were completed, such as expansions to the runways, terminals, and car parks. In 2005, the airport underwent construction to prepare for the arrival of the Airbus A380. This included widening the main runway by nearly 50ft, construction of dual jetbridges, as well as extension of the terminal building.Â  Today, more than 40 airlines offer passenger flights to Melbourne to over 120 destinations on four continents. Melbourne also receives a significant amount of cargo flights, as 8 cargo airlines serve Melbourne with regular scheduled cargo flights to 21 destinations.Â  Orbxâs rendition of Melbourne International Airport will feature high-resolution imagery, updated airport layout, SAM and OpenSAM custom animated jetways, dynamic lighting, animated 3D vegetation, detailed terminal interiors and control tower interiors, and custom ground polygons with detailed markings.

Announcing development last November, EYEVIONICS have been hard at work to create an Electronic Flight Information App. The tablet-based app will allow users to control critical systems in the aircraft without facing the cost of external simulator hardware. The integration into iOS and Android tablets allows users and cockpit builders to pull the virtual screen out of the sim into their hands. Key Features of EYEVIONICS EFIS: The app is available for free on both the iOS and Android store. Once installed, a licence can be purchased from their website for a one-off price of â¬19.99. This is just for MSFS integration and allows basic features. A more advanced version, what EYEVIONICS calls the "AVIATOR" package will be available at a later date. This includes 3D terrain, terrain alerts as well as a premium support system. Pricing for this package has not been confirmed by EYEVIONICS at the time of writing. â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold and join our Discord server. </summary>
