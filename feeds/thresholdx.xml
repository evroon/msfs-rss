    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Imaginesim has recently released the V2 of their Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Singapore with a yearly average of 58.9 million passengers, making it one of the world's busiest.Â  It was inaugurated 42 years ago when the Singaporean government was forced to build a new airport toÂ cope with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel.Â  At first, their original plan was to expand Paya Lebar, the former main airport in Singapore, but the 1973 Oil crisis changed everything. By 1975, they had already decided to build a brand new airport at the eastern tip of the main island of Changi, at the Changi Air Base. After its first year of operation, the airport had already handled an average of 12.1 million passengers, which led to the construction of a second passenger terminal in the 1990s. Terminal 3 soon followed in 2008, and then Terminal 4 in 2017. Terminal 5, which isÂ planned to be larger than all four combined, is expected to open in 2030. â It's a hub for FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, and Singapore Airlines. AirAsia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Hainan Airlines, IndiGo, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Swiss, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-definition textures, performance optimization, custom VDGS, custom animated jetways, 52 square kilometers of total coverage, Terminal 5's construction area, and more. â It's available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $24.75.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Flight Procedures Simulation (FPS) has recently released its Embraer 190 add-on for X-Plane 12. This is the next aircraft in line after the E195, which was released last summer. The developers behind the new Embraer 190 are the same as those who created the Supercritical Simulations Group (SSG), so this is not their first project for X-Plane. The Embraer 190 comes packed with a range of features. The Embraer E190 is a member of the Embraer E-Jet family. This Brazilian-made aircraft is a narrow-body airliner. The project was initially revealed by Embraer in 1997, but it was not officially unveiled until two years later. In 2002, the first E-Jet had its maiden flight, and the E190 model made its debut in 2004. The E-Jet family comprises of four commercial airliners, including the E170, E175, E190, and E195. To date, 568 E190s have been delivered, with the most prominent operators being JetBlue (48), AeromÃ©xico Connect (46), KLM Cityhopper (32), and Tianjin Airlines (31). Thanks to these operators, the E190 can be seen all over the world. The new Embraer 190 is packed with features, such as a highly accurate rendition of the E190, tons of animations, wing flex animation, custom lights, a detailed 3D cockpit, a custom FMS system, a custom flight model, custom sounds, an integrated tablet, and much more. The add-on is currently available on the X-Plane. Org Software Store for $69.00. However, there is a sale going on at the moment, and the price has been reduced to $55.00. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RW Profiles has recently released their rendition of Springfield-Branson National Airport (KSGF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Springfield and Branson in Missouri with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers as of 2023. It opened as Springfield-Greene County Airport in July 1945, replacing their former - much smaller - main airport.Â  American Airlines started scheduled service to the newly built airport in that same year, only pulling out in 1963. Chicago and Southern landed in 1948, and Ozark in 1951. Ozark was also responsible for the airportâs first scheduled jet service with their brand-new DC-9s in 1966.Â  The airportâs current name was adopted in 1992 as the administration attempted to capitalize on Bransonâs ever-growing tourist industry (even though itâs around 80 km away).Â  In May 2006, construction work started on a new terminal, inaugurated three years later, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills.Â  Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, United Express, DHL, FedEx Express, and UPS Airlines serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, accurate night lighting, aÂ custom runway, highly detailed models, up-to-date airport layout, LOD optimization, and an official GSX profile. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.24, requiring at least 2.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor has recently published a statement on their social network pages with their final decision on the release policy of their upcoming Boeing 777 v2 for X-Plane, including an exclusive non-public alpha program and a public beta later down the line. A previous statement made by Ramzzess on X-Plane.Org Forums stirred quite a bit of drama from the community as it mentioned their ponderation of a beta release without any vertical guidance at all, which led to a poll and their decision to feature a non-public alpha program first, where a select few would be chosen to purchase and test the product after signing a non-disclosure agreement.Â  Later, a public beta will roll out with all the major features (except CPDLC). Therefore, once that is out, the public beta testers will not have to experience the 777 without a working VNAV. Invitations for the closed alpha have been rolling out since yesterday (23/04). The purchased keys will be permanent and grant access to future updates. They also made sure to highlight that there are no applications for the closed alpha, and invitees will be chosen by themselves. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has shared more previews of their upcoming BrasÃ­lia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more. It was divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, terminal interiors, custom jetways with detailed interior, detailed landside, and more. Thereâs no release date yet, but itâs said to be coming soon. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight recently released their rendition of the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This two-seat fixed tricycle gear general aviation plane was designed for flight training, touring, and personal use. Introduced in 1978, the Tomahawk was designed from the get-go to be an affordable trainer aircraft with flight characteristics that would allow instructors to push the envelope a little further in comparison with the Cessna 152, which was the de facto trainer aircraft at the time: unlike its rival, the PA-38 would require specific pilot input to recover from spins. Nearly 2,500 units were produced during its relatively short production lifespan from 1978 to 1982.Â  Powered by a 112 hp Avco Lycoming O-235-L2C, the PA-38 can cruise at 185 km/h with a maximum range of 867 km and a service ceiling of 13,000ft.Â  Itâs still widely used for pilot training in many countries worldwide, reflected in the add-on with its considerable set of liveries. Other than the liveries, Just Flightâs rendition offers an accurately modeled rendition of the aircraft, with PBR materials, custom ground equipment, 8K textures, a truly tridimensional virtual cockpit, realistic wear and tear, an EFB for controlling various aircraft options, and more. The complete feature list follows below: â The add-on is available onÂ Just Flightâs websiteÂ for $41.99, requiring at least 1.6 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has released their rendition of North Weald Airfield for X-Plane 11 and 12, a small General Aviation airfield in Essex, UK. Opened in 1916 as Royal Flying Corps Station North Weald Bassett Aerodrome by the Royal Flying Corps (predecessor to the Royal Air Force), and in 1918 it became a Royal Air Force airport. This airfield played an important role in defending British skies during WWII. Hawker Hurricanes stationed in North Weald Airfield saw action in Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. Later on in the war, Norwegian squadrons were reassigned to this airfield. Between the 1940s and 60s, this aerodrome was used for RAF glider training. The last combat unit left North Weald in 1958, while the RAF completely withdrew in 1964, and since then this aerodrome has been classified as civilian. Today, North Weald sees over 40,000 movements on average per year and is home to a collection of vintage and veteran aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, Douglas Dakota, Curtiss Kittyhawk, as well as early jet aircraft such as Hawker Hunter, de Havilland Venom, de Havilland Vampire, Folland Gnat and BAC Jet Provost. North Weald Airfield will feature up-to-date orthophotos, 4K PBR airport buildings, 3D Forrest (XP12 only), 3D vegetation, 3D volumetric grass, Custom night lighting, realistic HD static aircraft, accurate ground markings including cracks and wear &amp; tear, dynamic weather effects (XP12 only) and accurate airport layout based on latest charts. You can buy this scenery on the Boundless store for $13.75 USD. It requires around 970MB when installed. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>
