    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6705af75ad660cb092e7069b_hok1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. KiwiFlightSim Limited has recently released their rendition of Hokitika Airport (NZHK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This uncontrolled aerodrome serves the homonymous city in New Zealand and has a yearly average of 40,000 passengers. The airportâs history dates back to the early days of aviation, with records going as far back as 1923 when Captain Maurice Buckley landed his Avro 504 in Hokitika. This marked a significant milestone for aviation in the region and demonstrated air travelâs potential to connect isolated communities on the West Coast. Eleven years later, Captain Bert Mercer established New Zealandâs first commercial airline â Air Travel NZ Ltd â, operating flights between Hokitika and other settlements in South Westland. Air Travel NZâs route coverage expanded greatly during World War 2, taking passengers to Greymouth, Westport, and Nelson. Its location, though, has changed over the years because of the previous areaâs susceptibility to flooding, leading to the construction of an entirely new airport in 1951. The new aerodrome attracted new airlines, with its first indeed scheduled service starting in 1953 with NAC, flying their DC-3 from Paraparaumu, Nelson, and Westport. Itâs currently served by Air New Zealand, with ATR flights to Christchurch. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom aerial imagery, custom 3D modeling, custom ground service equipment, hand-crafted apron markings, custom night lighting, custom windsocks, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $10.43, requiring at least 1 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>MK Studios Teases Upcoming Lisbon Airport V2 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-10-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/lpptv2"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. MK Studios has recently teased their upcoming rendition of Humberto Delgado Airport (LPPT) V2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Lisbon, in Portugal, with a yearly average of 33.6 million passengers, making it the busiest in the Country. Its history dates back to 1942, when it opened during the height of World War 2 as a neutral airport, smuggling people in and out of Europe, regardless of nationality. Such neutrality made it so it was heavily monitored by both the Axis and Allied forces and even earned it a movie plot. The post-war period saw a fast expansion, reaching the 100,000-passenger mark by 1954. At that point, it was served by Air France, British European Airways, Iberia, KLM, Sabena, Pan Am, and Trans World Airlines.Â  The late 50s/early 60s brought a runway upgrade to accommodate larger aircraft such as the 707 and the DC-8. In 1962, a new 3130-meter-long runway allowed even bigger aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, for Lisbonâs first direct route to New York in the 1970s. A new terminal was built in 2007 for exclusive use by low-cost carriers. It features 22 check-in desks and fifteen departure gates. â Terminal 1 was expanded shortly after, in 2011, with a large new shopping area, new airbridges and parking positions, and a new underground metro station. The airportâs infrastructure was also hugely improved during that period, with new cargo facilities, fuel storage, multiple refurbishments, and more. â In 2019, the government unveiled a new expansion program, which has been widely opposed due to environmental concerns. â Itâs a hub for TAP Air Portugal and an operating base for easyJet and Ryanair. Aer Lingus, Air France, American Airlines, Air Canada, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, KLM, Latam Airlines, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, Turkish, United, and Wizz Air also serve it. â The scenery is set to release in late October (23/10), and thereâs no information on pricing yet.

    <title>iFly Releases 737 MAX8 for MSFS in Pre-Release</title>
    <updated>2024-10-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/if73mp"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/670d2eb0b1defa971db61422_PIC08.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. In an announcement on their Discord, developers at Flight One Software have made the pre-release version of the hotly anticipated iFly Boeing 737 MAX8 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 available for purchase. The Boeing 737 MAX is Boeingâs newest narrow-body airliner series, developed in the 2000s and 2010s to replace the ageing 737 NG series. It features a redesigned fuselage, all-new winglets, and more efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines. It first flew in January 2016 and entered service in May 2017. In 2024, it is in service with 76 airlines across three variants. The 737 MAX is notable for the many technical problems that have plagued the aircraft.  In their announcement, Flight One Software said that this initial release is part of a âpre-releaseâ rollout to âstart testing purchasing through the iFly Managerâ. According to Flight One, the iFly 737 MAX8 will include many features, including comprehensive systems, detailed 3D modelling, accurate sounds created by BorisAudioWorks, functioning cabin systems, and even a lavatory that flushes, something never seen before for any addon of its kind in MSFS.  The developers say that more information about the plane will be âposted laterâ but donât specify an exact timeline. The aircraft is available for purchase at the Flight One Manager for $69.95 for new customers, but customers who have purchased the Prepar3D V5 version get a 40% discount, bringing the cost to $41.97, excluding local taxes.

    <title>Photorico Scenery Releases Mercedita International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/670ff5e395aa313fc96c0f29_merceditas.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Photorico Scenery has recently released their rendition of Mercedita International Airport (TJPS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Ponce, in Puerto Rico, with a yearly average of 215,000 passengers, making it the third busiest in the country. It was built in 1939 for airborne irrigation of sugarcane fields (which explains its name, given after the farm it served: Hacienda Mercedita). At first, it was only 260 meters long and 15 meters wide, with its first major upgrade only happening in the 1940s, when the United States Navy transformed it into a military airfield (it was eventually given back to Puerto Rico in 1947). It became Ponceâs main airport after the authorities determined the previous airport (Losey Field) didnât meet the minimum safety requirements, leading to plans to construct a new proper airport at Mercedita Airfield.Â  It was officially inaugurated as Mercedita Airport in late 1955, with the first scheduled service starting only a decade later, in 1965. The airport did not operate international routes until 1971. The first runway revamp project began in the early 1960s, extending it to 914 meters and accommodating a wider variety of aircraft. With international plans in mind, though, they had to expand it again in 1971, bringing its length to 1,500 meters so that Boeing 727s could safely fly into the airport.Â  The late 1980s brought an even more expressive overhaul, a new runway expansion (2,100 meters), and a remodeled passenger terminal.Â  In the early 1990s, the runway was extended by 580 meters so that American Airlines could fly there from Miami. Multiple improvements to the terminal building also added 1,350 square meters of additional space. The runway underwent further expansion in 2010, reaching its current total length of 2,440 meters, making it suitable for any narrowbody jet aircraft. Itâs served by Frontier Airlines and JetBlue, with flights to Orlando (Florida). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom PBR textures, custom night lighting, custom landmarks and VFR reference points, custom ground textures, and more.â Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $13.49, requiring at least 362.49 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Atelic Releases Madeira Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Atelic has recently released their rendition of Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport (LPMA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Madeira, in Portugal, with a yearly average of 4.8 million passengers, making it the 4th busiest in the Country. Opened in 1964 with a single, 1600-meter-long runway, which was relatively short for safe operation due to the airport's tricky nature, considered by many as the "European Kai Tak."Â  Traffic demand kept on growing, which led to the construction of a new passenger terminal in the early 1970s. The figures by then were nearing the half a million mark (yearly). In the late 1970s, a TAP Air Portugal 727 overran the runway, crashing shortly after and killing 131 of the 164 passengers onboard. The accident led to an urge to extend the runway, which was carried on in the early 1980s, adding 200 meters of total extension.Â  Twenty years later, a much more significant extension project was carried on, which involved drilling 180 pillars deep into the bedrock to ensure maximum stability. It was considered as one of the world's most difficult engineering projects at the time due to the terrain at hand. Such a feat earned the airport an Outstanding Structure Award in 2004 by the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering. It recently underwent a modernization project by its operator, bringing its infrastructure up to modern standards and allowing the handling of 1,400 passengers per hour. The runway's pillared structure was also strengthened, just in case. It's a focus city for TAP Air Portugal and an operating base for Ryanair. Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Condor, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Transavia, TUI (UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany), United Airlines, and Wizz Air also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-definition terrain, an up-to-date ground layout, custom runway slope matching real figures, a full terminal interior, custom vegetation, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $22.44, requiring at least 1.60 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. MK Studios announced in their Discord server their plans for the remainder of 2024 and beyond, including a new airport on the North American West Coast (yet to be revealed) and two big airports in Europe.Â  Their upcoming Lisbon Airport V2 is still set to release on Wednesday (23/10), and the pricing is now known: roughly $18.46 (tax excluded). Owners of the previous version will get a 25% discount. V2 owners will be eligible for a free Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 upgrade. Still on that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 note, all of their products released in 2024 will receive free upgrades, whereas older products will still demand further investigation as they were developed using different techniques which might impact performance negatively, and it may require the redevelopment of the ground poly and LODs. While the 2020 versions might work fine in 2024 without an upgrade patch, it wonât be officially supported and may induce issues. â They have also announced two new European airports: Zurich Airport (LSZH) and DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (EDDL), which will be released in 2024 and Q1 2025, respectively. They also plan to update La Guardia (KLGA) once terminal C is fully finished and develop a new airport âon the top of the West Coast.â â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Orbx has recently previewed their upcoming scenery for MSFS - Maitland Airport (YMND). Located in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia, this airport receives no airline service and is mostly used by general aviation.Â  After the airfield near Rutherford had been closed due to urban development, the Royal Newcastle Aero Club moved all of their operations and headquarters to the Maitland Airport in 1963, and five years later, a new runway was added, while between 1972 and 1977, both runways have received expansions and were paved.Â  The only times this airport received airline service were for the brief period in the 1980s when Club Air offered commuter flights to Sydney and in 1988 when Yanda Airlines operated on the same route, until the suspension of their Air Operatorâs Certificate in 2001. This airport is also called Russel Airfield, named in honour of Robert Russel, the President of the Royal Newcastle Aero Club (RNAC) in 1966. Besides the RNAC, it is also the home airfield of Paul Bennet, an Australian aerobatic pilot, known for his varied collection of aircraft and airshows.Â Throughout its history, the Russel Field has also been the host of many airshows and air races. Orbxâs rendition of the Maitland Airport features 3D custom-modelled airport facilities, Paul Bennetâs hangar, highly detailed ground markings, custom animated hangar doors, improved ground textures and terraforming, custom apron, runway and approach lights, and improved vegetation around the airport. Along with the previews of the upcoming product, Orbx has also teased the release of two aircraft: Wolf Pitts Pro (the aircraft used by Paul Bennet), and the TBM Avenger. This rendition will cost 14,99 AUD, which is roughly around 9,90 $. No information about the release date of the scenery, the Pitts Pro or the TBM Avenger has been released, however, as always, Threshold will keep you updated! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â â</summary>
