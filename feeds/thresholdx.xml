    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has released version 1.1.0 of its A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing a raft of improvements and additions, including the long-awaited A350 ULR variant. The A350 ULR, or Ultra Long Range, features an increased maximum takeoff weight and fuel capacity, with a range of up to 9,700 nautical miles. Designed for non-stop, ultra-long-haul flights, it supports operations lasting over 19 hours, with Singapore Airlines operating the type exclusively, in a two-class, premium-heavy configuration. iniBuilds has adapted this layout for their ULR variant in MSFS 2024, bringing a reworked cabin and compatibility with FS24âs career mode, including interactive boarding procedures. Further additions include the integration of functional emergency evacuation slides and the PDOS (Power Door Opening System) for opening the engine cowlings. Performance has seen additional improvements, with reduced CPU load and a streamlined WASM structure. Furthermore, iniBuilds has overhauled the ECAM, refined the fly-by-wire system, and introduced several new FMS features, including Conditional Descent Advisory and Estimated Time to Target. The update also introduces support for iniBuilds' new modular cabin packs, a separately sold line of swappable, airline-specific interiors, providing realistic cabin layouts from carriers like Air France, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa. Artwork updates include refined nose cone shading, reworked cockpit sidesticks, adjusted camera positions, and cockpit storm lighting. iniBuilds has also integrated event-driven scenarios and confirmed upcoming support for a 3D HUD with dynamic projection and crosswind adaptation. Despite popular demand, 8x time compression remains unsupported, due to instability in the autopilot logic at high speeds. iniBuilds also affirmed their confidence in the aircraftâs flight model, citing validation through full-motion simulators, while noting user experience may vary depending on hardware. The developer recommends users apply a 1:1 axis curve for the most accurate control feel.Â  â iniBuilds closed their post with a single teaser image of what appears to be an Airbus A340-300, possibly hinting at their next big project. As the A350 Airliner enters a more mature development phase, iniBuilds plans to space out future updates, while continuing work on feature enhancements and long-term refinements. â You can find the

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar has during during #FSExpoFriday 2025 given an update on the future of X-Plane 12, with performance improvements, art upgrades, and major simulation system enhancements all in active development. The team confirmed that version 12.2.1 will enter public beta next Friday, while the highly anticipated 12.3.0 release will begin private beta testing the same day. â The presentation began with a recap of version 12.2, which is now publicly available. Key fixes and visual improvements include updated ground textures, revised lighting and atmospheric rendering, new aircraft braking effects, and a resolution to the long-standing dark cockpit issue, significantly improving visibility across default aircraft. Laminar also previewed upcoming additions to the X-Plane Gateway, with new community-driven assets currently in development. These include various fire trucks, police cars, construction vehicles, enhanced ramp lighting, and improved ground markings. Much of this work is being led by newly joined scenery artist Justin, also known as Mr. X, and the team highlighted the ability to customise ramps with new compass roses, labels, and colours. The upcoming 12.3.0 version will introduce a foundational shift in how X-Plane uses CPU resources. Laminar has confirmed that multi-core rendering is now in development, with a new job system already built to handle AI traffic, texture paging, and network synchronisation. Internal testing has demonstrated performance gains of up to 30% at graphically intensive airports, such as Frankfurt. Additional optimisation targets GPU and VRAM usage. Laminar is currently refining cloud rendering and night lighting processes, which should result in greater efficiency and reduced GPU workload, particularly beneficial for users running in 4K. Laminar is adopting new virtual memory techniques, to speed up texture loading and safely offload unused graphical assets. The default Airbus A330 is set for a major update, with reworked metallic surfaces, improved textures, detailed weathering and glare shield fixes.  Furthermore, brake fire simulations, refined lighting and cabin ambience, dynamic passenger lighting, and altitude-aware illumination modes were also shown off. A major technical addition is a fully GPU-bound weather radar, integrated by default on the default Boeing 737-800, A330-300, MD-82, Cirrus Visionjet, Baron B58 and Citation X.  The default weather radar includes manual tilt, ground clutter filtering, sector scanning, and predictive wind shear alerts. An API has been made available for third-party developers to integrate the feature into their products. â The G1000 avionics suite has also been upgraded, now featuring synthetic vision, rendered entirely on the GPU. This allows terrain, obstacle, and traffic overlays, including support for online networks like VATSIM and IVAO, without adding CPU overhead or impacting performance. Beyond the simulator core, Laminar reaffirmed progress on its new X-Plane Store. The backend now supports account-based logins and is integrating modern payment systems. â More details are expected as development on the 12.3.0 update continues. â For all the latest updates, be sure to follow Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft and ToLiss have announced a new partnership at this year's FlightSimExpo, confirming development of an Airbus A340-600 for MSFS. The upcoming release will mark ToLissâ first entry into the MSFS platform, having already built a reputation for high-fidelity Airbus aircraft in X-Plane. In a statement published on Facebook, ToLiss said the aircraft will feature their proprietary systems suite adapted from X-Plane. It will also include a custom-built flight model, designed specifically for MSFS.  The aircraft is being jointly developed, with Aerosoft handling modelling and visual assets, and ToLiss the flight and systems modelling. While no release timeline has been shared, a recently published video on the Aerosoft Flight YouTube channel showcases the A340 handling three different technical scenarios, including an engine failure after takeoff, and sections of an RNAV approach.Â  A standout feature is a seemingly working taxi camera, rarely seen in MSFS due to simulator limitations. ToLiss has long been recognised in the X-Plane community for its attention to detail and system accuracy, notably in the A319, A321, A340 and A330neo series. Their upcoming A340-600 for MSFS aims to bring the same level of depth to a new audience. â Further details on the project, including pricing and release platforms, are expected as development continues. â Be sure to follow Threshold for the latest updates! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Drzewiecki Design has recently released its rendition of Western Sydney International Airport (YSWS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport is situated approximately 38 miles from the center of Sydney and is currently under construction, with a projected completion date at the end of 2026. Once finished, it will serve as a supplement to the existing Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (YSSY). Construction of the new Western Sydney International Airport began in 2018 and is expected to be completed by late 2026. This airport will be notable for using a remote and virtual control tower rather than the traditional air traffic control tower, making it the first airport in Australia to feature this technology. The new airport is being built to supplement the existing Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport (YSSY), which has limited space for expansion. As of now, airlines including Qantas, Jetstar, and Singapore Airlines have announced plans to operate flights to the new airport. The new scenery includes an up-to-date and high-quality model of the airport, advanced night lighting, custom jetways, and many additional features. The newly released Western Sydney International Airport is now available from SimMarket for approximately $23.44. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations recently shared a batch of Aerostar 600 screenshots provided by their beta testers. These screenshots showcase many aspects of the 3D model, cockpit features, and feature-rich electronic flight bag. A few days ago, A2A finally announced a release date for the Aerostar, albeit in an early access program, allowing the community to experience the airplane as it undergoes its final polishing processes.Â  While not much was shared regarding features or images, the developers have now satiated everyoneâs curiosity with a substantial batch of screenshots, showcasing its internals and externals under different weather and lighting conditions and multiple hints on features.Â  The airplaneâs autopilot is a custom-simulated two-axis Century IV from the late 1970s, not relying on MSFSâs default systems. Furthermore, the EFB â despite looking similar â was fully rewritten and works as a native MSFS 2024 app, meaning it can also display other MSFS 2024 apps such as their flight planner, charts, SimBrief, Navigraph, and so on. Like their Comanche 250, the Aerostar will be compatible with multiple GPS options, including the PMS GTN750, the TDS GTN750Xi, and the KLN90B. Additionally, they have simulated two digital engine monitors this time: the JPI EDM 790 and the EDM 760.Â  Thereâs no pricing or a date for the release yet, but Threshold will keep you informed!
