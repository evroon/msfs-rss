    <summary>Sim: FS24. A2A Simulations has released updates to the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 versions of the Accu-Sim Aerostar 600, fixing various bugs in both and adding GPS unit real-time detection (2024 only).Â  Update v1.0.1 (MSFS 2024) adds the aforementioned GPS unit real-time detection, the noise cancellation device tooltip now shows its battery state, the right magneto bindings were fixed, the rare autopilot initialization issue was wholly mitigated, and some typos were addressed. Update v1.0.2 (MSFS 2020), on the other hand, fixes a problem with the GPSS not tracking the magenta line correctly and addresses the autopilot pitch reference bindings. The add-on is available on their website for $49.99. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds is heading far north, with a detailed rendition of Svalbard Airport, Longyear (ENSB), for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Billed as one of the worldâs northernmost commercial airports, this Arctic outpost will arrive pretty soon, with a launch price of $13,42, excluding sales tax. Operationally, ENSB links Svalbard to mainland Norway, with scheduled flights to Oslo and TromsÃ¸, as well as seasonal and charter services that support tourism and research. iniBuilds says the package captures the isolation and atmosphere of âpolarâ aviation, with custom ground textures across the airfield, bespoke night lighting, and carefully modelled landside areas, even including the famous Global Seed Vault on PlatÃ¥berget. Terminal interiors feature parallax and bespoke assets, and the airside environment is modelled with accurate ground clutter, signage, and static aircraft, including helicopters and a C172.Â The area surrounding the airport is also modelled. A custom GSX profile is included, and all models have LODs incorporated. Set against a collection of steep mountains, sea ice, and rapidly changing weather, Longyearbyen is the perfect place for fun approaches. Weâll keep you updated on its release.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts has just released version 2.1.0 of their E-Jets Family for X-Plane 12,Â  a free update that brings a fully integrated weather radar, a string of fixes and some quality-of-life tweaks.Â  Tied into XP12.3âs new precipitation data, the radar paints real returns on the PFD and MFD. v2.1.0 also smooths flight director behaviour after take-off, adds new HSI modes, including full compass, arc, and an arc-with-flight-plan option, and lets you hide the missed approach from the map. Cabin lighting bleed-through at night has been fixed, EFB crashes have been addressed, and overall compatibility with XP12.3 has been confirmed.Â  Looking ahead, X-Crafts is planning a free E-Jets 3.1 update, with the same radar tech and further map improvements, a new, from-the-ground-up ERJ Family 2.0 for XP12, and the next-gen, E-Jets Family 3.0. Whatâs New in v2.1.0 You can download v2.1.0 via SkunkCrafts or by re-downloading from your store account. New customers can purchase the E-Jets in various single and bundle deals, ranging from $74.95 to $149.95. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>MM Simulations Releases Frankfurt-Hahn Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-10-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mmshahn"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68f21d1492c693bb78593322_hahn1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Frankfurt-Hahn Airport (EDFH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the low-cost oriented gateway to the Rhineland. Hahn dates back to the early 1950s when it was founded by occupying French forces and taken over by the USAF a year later, where it initially hosted the 7356th Air Base Group, responsible for improving the facilities and getting it into an operational state. The USAF used the Hahn Air Base until the early 1990s, when it was handed over to Germany. The German government decided to transform the Air Base into a civil airport to alleviate the traffic at Frankfurt International Airport. Nowadays, the airport averages around 1.3 million passengers yearly, served by Ryanair or WizzAir, the two low-cost giants operating in Hahn. The Irish carrier offers seventeen fixed destinations (and fifteen seasonals), and the Hungarian sports eight destinations. As a curiosity, Frankfurt-Hahn recently filed for bankruptcy and was sold to a new investor in mid-2022, which ended up not transferring the funds. Now they have signed two preliminary contracts with two new potential buyers, one of them being no more, no less than the owner of the NÃ¼rburgring. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with handcrafted terrain elevation, updated satellite imagery, a detailed 3D terminal, an accurate ground layout, custom ground textures, and more. â Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $19.87, requiring at least 1.2 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraphâs SimBrief now features real-world European routes, which were hard to obtain in the past due to certain restrictions, which is why only North America used to feature real-world routes.Â  â Navigraph has finally managed to get their hands on that data, though, so SimBrief now features high-quality routes straight into the planner, with the same level of accuracy as their NA data set. â They demonstrated the new system by flying from Stansted, London, to Skiathos (Greece) on a Jet2 737-800. The image below shows that the route planner now displays a green label marked as âreal worldâ next to the route string.Â  To ensure the routing is real, they ran it through Eurocontrol for validation, throwing no errors. The new data set is available to every SimBrief user, but non-Navigraph subscribers may encounter errors or discrepancies due to their out-of-date cycle.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has shared a batch of A340 previews on their Discord, complete with a development brief from community manager Raphael.Â  Furthermore, the long-haul aircraft is now set to release ahead of Aerosoftâs A330 NEO, which was previously said to release in the Fall of 2025. The previews shared focus on cockpit and cabin progress, with Aerosoft stressing that these are still in an unfinished state, shared for transparencyâs sake. Among the highlights is the teamâs so-called âsleeping sidestickâ, hopefully a bug to be fixed. Colours, wear, and detailing are still being tuned, but the core systems shown are functioning, according to Rafi. Expect more angles in upcoming Friday updates, including exterior modelling. A full showcase is expected closer to launch. For the full update, visit Aerosoft's Discord server. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. IndiaFoxtEcho has finally resurfaced with new details on its long-awaited Eurofighter Typhoon for Microsoft Flight Simulator, and this time, thereâs a potential release window. In a new post, celebrating the studioâs 10th anniversary, the team confirmed they are now deep into debugging the Typhoon, and âhopefullyâ preparing it for release in November. The update comes after several months of radio silence, which the team addressed directly, apologising for the lack of news, while reassuring fans that progress has not stalled. According to IndiaFoxtEcho, the Eurofighter is currently being tested by a mix of internal staff and real-world Typhoon pilots. Alongside the Typhoon, IndiaFoxtEcho shared news on a few other projects. Their F-16A, developed in collaboration with Heatblur Simulations, is progressing steadily on the art side and is now targeted for a Q1 2026 release.  The TA-4J remains on hold until the Typhoon is wrapped, while DCS fans can look forward to ongoing work on the G.91 and a maintenance realignment for the MB.339.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently released their newest scenery creation for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, this time heading to the arctic airport of Svalbard Longyearbyen (ENSB). Located at 78 degrees north of the equator, the airport is the northernmost with scheduled passenger service. The first airport on Svalbard was constructed during World War II by the Luftwaffe. After the war, it was taken over by the Norwegian Air Force, who started occasional postal flights. However, operations were tricky due to harsh conditions, and could only operate a few months out of the year. In the 1970s, it was decided that a new airport was needed, so a site was selected near Hotellneset, and construction began in 1973. Svalbard Airport was officially opened on September 2, 1975 with its first flight being operated by SAS. Over the years, the airport has undergone various renovations, with the most recent being an upgrade to the passenger terminal in 2007. Today, the airport serves as a vital link to mainland Norway, with flights to Oslo and Tromso being operated by both SAS and Norwegian. Additionally, there are charter flights to Moscow and Murmansk operated by Arktikugol, a Russian mining company, to serve the mining town of Barentsburg, which has a population primarily consisting of Russian nationals. iniBuildsâ rendition features high-quality textures, detailed building interiors and parallax, recreation of landside areas including the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, custom night lighting, custom static aircraft, and more. Svalbard Airport is available for purchase on the iniBuilds Store for approximately $13.35, requiring at least 2.29GB of disk space. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimPixel has recently launched its version of Breda International Airport (EHSE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This general aviation aerodrome is located in North Brabant, Netherlands, and features a runway that is 2,723 feet long. Opened in 1949 as a glider field, the airfield was originally named Seppe Airfield. Powered aircraft began flying at the airport in 1969. In 2002, the original grass runway was replaced with an asphalt runway. The airfield does not accommodate aircraft with jet engines. In 2015, the airfield was rebranded from Seppe Airfield to Breda International Airport, following an announcement made in 2014. The ICAO code EHSE remained unchanged. In addition to general aviation traffic, the airfield is home to the Vliegend Museum Seppe, which showcases various aircraft on display. The aviation training company Aviation Performance Solutions is also located at the airfield. The scenery is rich with features like high-resolution textures, custom 3D models, dynamic lighting, detailed interiors, static aircraft, ground vehicles, and much more. The newly released Breda International Airport by SimPixel is now available from iniBuilds for approximately $9.39. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. VeroRoutes has released their Pilot-Controlled Lighting addon for MSFS 2024, a first for the sim, letting you key the mic to control the runway lights.Â  You do this by tuning the published PCL frequency, clicking your push-to-talk three, five, or seven times within five seconds, and the lights will then spring on for 15 minutes, with low, medium, or high intensity. Coverage is broad, too. The add-on simulates pilot-activated lighting at roughly 4,500 airfields and heliports worldwide, with runway edge, centreline, threshold, and approach systems all modelled.Â  By default, the field stays dark, and the package can even be driven remotely via SimConnect. You can try it with a free trial, then pick it up from the VeroRoutes website forÂ $23.20, as well as simMarket. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

The cockpit environment has been carefully modelled, and it also includes authentic checklists. You can swap between a glass cockpit and steam gauges on the fly, and the aeroplane also supports VR out of the box.Â  Bundled with the release is a companion activity pack, too, giving plenty of things to do with the new plane.
