    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released their long-awaited physics-based camera system for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, providing realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, creating unparalleled immersion. For the unfamiliar, ChasePlane was originally released in 2016 for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and later became compatible with Prepar3D, rapidly becoming the de facto camera application for ESP-based simulators at the time. After many years of waiting, Parallel 42 finally managed to break Asoboâs absurdly locked camera system, bringing ChasePlane to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 in early 2025, with the promise of eventually making it 2024 compatible, which has now been fulfilled. â The add-on features highly realistic physics-based camera behavior based on extensive research and real-world pilot footage. This warrants realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, embracing the flight model rather than altering it. Pilots can feel the vibration during the take-off roll, the rush of turbulence, and the fluid shifts during maneuvers. â ChasePlane 2020 owners can upgrade to 2024 for free by using the code âCPWENâ at the checkout page. â Itâs available in their store for $30.00.

    <title>iniBuilds Announces Liverpool John Lennon and Dallas Fort Worth Airports for MSFS24</title>
    <updated>2025-12-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/iadfwl"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6945ee14a7000f4791f1cb63_DFW8.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. In their most recent scenery development recap on their forums, iniBuilds has confirmed that they are working on renditions of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (EGGP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is one of the worldâs busiest airports by aircraft movement, and recreating the complexity and scale of the airport has been quite the task for the iniBuilds team. Development work has been underway for months, ranging from detailed ground poly work to getting the unique architecture of the terminals correct. Greg Jones, iniBuildsâ Head of Scenery and Geospatial Development, says that DFWâs size has been a challenge for the team to adapt their work flow integrating new features.Â  âAdopting MSFS2024 as our core development platform gave us new opportunities to introduce levels of detail and quality previously not possible. â¦ Early in 2025, we had a commercial opportunity to work on Dallas Fort Worth. We jumped at the chance to produce what will be, by far, the largest project weâve ever doneâ, Jones explains. He expands on their goals for DFW, stating that they are putting âperformance at the core of everythingâ and â[The] testing team is hard at work ironing out any kinks, and so far the results have been stellarâ. As of writing, iniBuilds has not confirmed a release date for their rendition of DFW, but they say that users âshouldnât have to wait many more monthsâ for a release. â Following in the footsteps of their recent release of Manchester and Leeds Bradford v2, iniBuildsâ newest UK airport will be Liverpool John Lennon, an airport with a rich history and scenic approach over the river Mersey. In their announcement iniBuilds asks for help from anyone who works at Liverpool John Lennon Airport or has airside access and can provide high-quality reference photography or technical data. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>FSLabs Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently published a new development update regarding the long-awaited Pratt &amp; Whitney update for their A321neo, released earlier this year with LEAPs as the sole engine option initially. A combination of technical challenges and continued changes introduced through Sim Updates in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has necessitated unexpected additional work and testing validation, which has pushed the updateâs rollout date forward. Furthermore, they are actively supporting Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, while also laying the groundwork for a fully native 2024 product line, which adds further complexity to their development process. Rather than pushing a half-baked update, FSLabs chose to wait it out until itâs all deemed properly stable, avoiding a sequence of micro-updates.  They also do not expect the aforementioned update to be released before Christmas, as they donât want to put unnecessary strain on their quality assurance and support teams, and they want to ensure full availability when the update is shipped. Development and testing will absolutely not stop during the holidays, though. They have also shared a few screenshots from their Â current work-in-progress builds, and more details will be shared soon. â The add-on is available on their website for $69.95.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has recently released their updated rendition of Rovaniemi Airport (EFRO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the third-busiest airport in Finland, serving 500,000 passengers annually. It was built in 1940, originally featuring two grass runways. It was heavily utilized as a Luftwaffe Air base and supply center during the Second Soviet-Finnish War between 1941 and 1944. By the end of the conflict, the airport was heavily compromised. Rebuilding work was concluded in 1948, and regular traffic resumed in the second half of the same year. The current terminal building was completed in 1992 and expanded in 2000 with the addition of jetways. The runway underwent renovation work in 2016, with new pavement and LED lights, and 2019 marked the completion of the terminalâs third enlargement. Itâs served all year long by Finnair, and a multitude of European carriers visit Rovaniemi during the winter season (Aer Lingus, Air France, easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, to name a few). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, high-quality 3D models, custom terminal interiors, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, precise runway elevation data, and more. â Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $19.42, requiring at least 3.04 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In a surprise announcement, Laminar Research has released the beta version of their C-Check update, better known as X-Plane 12.4.0 Beta. The stated goal of the beta is to lay the groundwork forÂ  X-Planeâs future.Â  Laminar Research has accomplished this by replacing core elements of the simulator and improving aircraft systems. The default A330 has been reworked to a "payware level", now, for example, allowing for realistic cold and dark starts. It also gives you the tools needed to conduct proper oceanic and long-haul flights. This includes a third MCDU for Airline Operational Communications.Â  The autopilot system has also been improved, making for smoother turns, better flight plan tracking, and more reliable coupled approaches. Finally, emergencies can now be simulated. On the general aviation side, X-Planeâs default X430 and X530 now have working terrain, traffic, and weather pages, while the X1000 now features a dedicated page showing ETE/ETA.Â  For lovers of custom scenery, the team has included a rendition of Bilbao Airport (LEBB) in Spain. Other improvements in the beta include native support for the Tobii Eye Tracker 5 on Windows, multi-threaded scenery processing, virtual reality improvements, ATC improvements, and more!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has just released its highly anticipated version of Harstad/Narvik Airport (ENEV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Located in northern Norway, the airport serves the cities of Harstad and Narvik and handles over 800,000 passengers annually. The airport first opened its doors in 1973, following a two-year construction period that began in 1971. There was a lengthy debate and planning process before the construction of the airport commenced. When it first opened, the airport featured a runway that was 5,200 feet long, which has since been extended to its current length of 9,226 feet. Today, the airport serves as a joint public and military facility, with airlines such as Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e operating flights both domestically and internationally. The scenery package includes features like accurate runway, taxiway, and apron layouts, detailed interior and exterior modelling of terminals, custom local hangars and airport buildings, and realistic ground textures, markings, and signage, among others. Harstad/Narvik Airport by MM Simulations is now available on SimMarket for approximately $23.52. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has published its final development update of 2025, opening with a recap of the past year before pivoting to the official announcement of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The update begins by looking back at a busy, at times challenging, year for the studio. iniBuilds highlights the releases of the A350 Airliner, A340 Airliner, F406 Caravan II, and Spartan 7W Executive, alongside an extended post-launch support cycle, particularly for the A350.Â  Much of the retrospective focuses on performance optimisation, WASM stability work, and long-term refinement across its MSFS 2024 fleet, rather than introducing significant new developments. One forward-looking note does emerge from the recap, however, with iniBuilds confirming that a free VIP variant of the A340 Airliner is scheduled to arrive in January. With housekeeping out of the way, IniBuilds moves to the main attraction. That is, the official confirmation of the iniBuilds Lockheed L-1011 TriStar for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.Â  iniBuilds says the goal is to deliver the most authentic and immersive TriStar experience yet seen in home simulation, providing a ground-up recreation of the iconic widebody, and designed to take full advantage of MSFS 2024âs new features. The project will focus primarily on the L-1011-500 âShortbodyâ variant, developed using extensive real-aircraft access, hands-on reference sessions, and detailed research.Â  Planned features include fully simulated electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and environmental systems, the Automatic Flight Control System, with CAT IIIB autoland, and multiple navigation configurations. These range from analogue radio navigation to the triple Litton INS setup, with optional modern navigation upgrades also available. A standout inclusion is the TriStarâs Performance Management System, integrated with the AFCS and INS. The system will compute optimal climb, cruise, and descent profiles, based on live aircraft data. Sound design is being handled by Echo19, who secured access to an operational TriStar at the TriStar Experience in Kansas City, Missouri.Â  iniBuilds continues by saying they have travelled internationally to gather extensive reference material, with the aircraft featuring high-fidelity exterior and interior modelling, evolving dynamic weathering, and an optional retrofit lower-deck lounge, a nod to one of the TriStarâs most distinctive design features. Further deep dives into the RB211 engines, Direct Lift Control, flight engineer systems, and additional features are planned for future development updates. Read the full update here.
