    <title>NZA Simulations Releases Wanaka Region for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. NZA Simulations has recently released their rendition of Wanaka Airport (NZWF) and its surroundings for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring over 5000 square kilometers of enhanced terrain, nine airports, and more. Wanaka Airport serves the town of Wanaka, in Otago, New Zealand, with a passenger average circling around the 5 digit mark (exact numbers are not available).Â  It was built in 1984 on top of a pre-existing private airstrip owned by Tim Wallis, a Kiwi businessman and aviation entrepreneur, ultimately replacing Mount Iron Aerodrome, which used to be Wanakaâs only airport and deemed too small for their plans back then. Air New Zealand started scheduled services in 2004, canceling them after only nine years due to low demand (which would only peak during airshow weekends). Local businesses rapidly stepped in to fill the gap, albeit unsuccessfully.Â  â In late 2020, SoundsAir started a scheduled service route to Christchurch airport, which is currently the airportâs only commercial traffic.Â  Other than the airport itself, the package also offers a 5000 square kilometer coverage around its surroundings, with nine airports in total, four helipads, 20+ mountain huts, 3D models, PBR texturing, high-resolution aerial imagery, 3D interiors for the main airport, Skydive Wanaka Hangar &amp; Customer area, Whare Kea Chalet Hut, Aspiring Helicopters, and Makarora Hangars. Below is a map with all the airports, airstrips, and landmarks included: Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $21.72, requiring at least 4.19 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Fenix Simulations Releases Sharklets Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/sharks"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/672ad40126a28c4a9b738d5a_sharklets20.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Fenix Simulations has recently released the long-awaited sharklets update for their Airbus family lineup (except for the A319) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, at no extra cost and with a wealth of new features. While the A320 and the A321 will be getting the sharklets as of right now, the A319 will take a while. They claim it's been a bit tricky to obtain reliable data on it, as not many exist in real life.Â  The sharklets are more than just a visual thing. Airbus went the extra mile to warrant similar handling and overall behavior between both variants, mainly on the "software" side of things, making it hardly noticeable if one doesn't look closely enough. Fenix Simulations claims to have accurately replicated the subtle system differences and flight dynamics behavior, warranting a realistic experience. The flight model has been adjusted to the sharklets, with a bit more lift on the wings, less drag, and extra energy on flare, which is said to be subtle but noticeable if you pay close attention. Regardless, the fly-by-wire system should make the overall handling feel relatively homogeneous across all variants, as in real life. As previously mentioned, there are also software changes, with upgrades to the two elevator and aileron computers, three spoiler elevator computers, and the two flight augmentation computers, as well as less significant changes to the ECAM, fuel, FMGC, and more.Â  Among these ELAC changes, Fenix Simulations highlights the Load Alleviation Function, which alleviates wing structure loading, as the extra weight of the sharklets also means more strain on the wings, making them bend more aggressively in extreme conditions. The LAF system rapidly deploys ailerons upwards while in-flight or spoilers 4 and 5 to prevent that. The FBW system was also tweaked to accommodate the new system and its inherencies. Ground physics also underwent improvements. The tiller mapping from the real A320 was applied to their add-on, adding a bit of extra weight to the taxi phase across their entire range of aircraft (wingtips included). They have also built a custom wingflex model to accommodate the more obvious sharklet wingflex, taking into account a lot of factors such as localized forces, fuel tank level, etc. It has also been backported to the wingtip fences. They also reinforce that it's mostly a work in progress and might not be perfect initially. The ADIRS model has been upgraded to the newer version, applying to both aircraft. The old one has been ultimately retired as it's rare in currently flying A320s anymore. The ACP was also upgraded, and the old one was phased out. They plan on bringing both the old ADIRS and ACP as options in the future. The new digital standby instrument has also been added as an integral - and forced - part of the sharklets modernization, complete with the correct degraded displays and its functions. Lastly, the ACT tanks were added to the A321, allowing for realistically operated transcontinental flights and routes like Finnair's HELâPMI. The presence of the ACTs also means less space in the cargo compartment, which is also modeled. The complete changelog follows down below: Avionics and Systems The update is available right now via Fenix Installer. The full bundle (A319/A320/A321) is available on their website for roughly $103.87. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Update Nov. 15 - 1700z: Microsoft have now provided comment on the delays and have outlined a plan to address the situation. Read more about it here. â In an email sent out to customers this week, Aerosoft has stated that orders for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Collectorâs Edition have been delayed. Delays will affect orders made on Aerosoftâs EU Store, but orders made on their US Store will be delivered on schedule. According to the email, the delay has been caused by âunexpected shipping delays to our warehouse in Germanyâ. Aerosoft has not expanded on what specifically caused those delays. An exact timeline has not been given as of the time of writing, but they expect shipments to begin to customers âin the first week of Decemberâ. Aerosoft has further confirmed that activation codes will not be sent in advance of delivery on release day of FS24 on November 19th, but instead come delivered with the physical items, so simmers who bought the Collectorâs Edition in Europe will have to wait until their package arrives. As of the time of writing, Microsoft has not yet commented on the delays, but Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. A2A Simulations has published a statement on its plans for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 development. The statement includes news on its Comanche 250 port for the new platform and its upcoming Aerostar 600. They have recently been granted access to the new SDK, and the Comanche 250 appears to work fine in MSFS 2024, with only a few issues requiring addressing, but Accu-Sim (the core system of their Comanche and all future planes) plays nicely with it. It should be available for the new simulator on day one or shortly after. A2A also said they will be providing assistance to transfer over the airframe state, files, and stuff to the new simulator when the time comes. Regarding fully bringing the Comanche to MSFS 2024 standards, itâs still under evaluation given the extra requirements for compliance, which has yet to be gauged whether it will be a lot of work. Therefore, no decision has been made yet about a native version for 2024. The 2020 version, though, should work in the new simulator just fine, albeit without the extra features that could be made possible with the latest SDK standards. They are still working on the Aerostar 600, albeit with the difference that the potential release date has been moved to 2025, as they need to reconsider their requirements for the new SDK. They reiterate aircraft development for MSFS is their top priority, and they plan on releasing more aircraft next year. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FSLabs recently confirmed the development and potential imminent release of their A321-X for Microsoft Flight Simulator after one of their forum members found a link to a new FSL webpage with references to the new product, which has yet to be officially announced.Â  Lefteris Kalamaras, FSLabsâ CEO, has confirmed the veracity of the leaked information and even attached two screenshots of the upcoming product. He also reiterated that some leaked information was merely placeholders and not representative of what would come. FSLabs rose to fame in 2016 after releasing the first high-fidelity Airbus A320 add-on in history. This add-on allowed Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3d users to experience the day-to-day operation of one of the most popular airliners of all time, one that had not yet been developed to such standards (which quickly changed within five years). â While thereâs no official feature list or any other concrete information for the time being, the company is known for pushing the boundaries of realism with most of their products, and that might be the case with their first step into the ânewâ simulator.Â  Itâs also unknown whether it will be available for MSFS 2020, 2024, or both. Threshold will ensure that you are covered should further information be revealed.</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. BMWorld and AmSim recently released their rendition of Washington Dulles International Airport (KIAD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Washington, D.C., with an average yearly of 25 million passengers. Opened in 1962, itâs one of the three major airports â and second busiest â serving the Metropolitan Washington Area, along with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (KDCA) and Baltimore/Washington International Airport (KBWI).Â  The original design was tweaked for the first time in 1985 when it no longer suited its role as Washingtonâs main airport. Midfield concourses were constructed to facilitate walking between terminals for connecting flights and other such activities, consequently unclogging the main terminal. Concourses C and D were the first to be built, followed by A and B, with the former only reaching completion in 2004. Plans call for a new three-story south concourse covering 51,000 square meters in total area, ultimately replacing Concourse Aâs regional gates from the late 1990s. Itâs a hub for Southern Airways Express and United Airlines and served by Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Allegiant Air, All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, Turkish Airlines, United Express, Virgin Atlantic, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution custom ground textures, custom ground markings, an up-to-date airport layout, a detailed terminal area, animated jetways, fully modeled terminal interiors, and more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $21.09, requiring at least 1.58 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has recently added live traffic functionality and ATC sectors to their Charts app, albeit in beta. The new functionalities will allow users to visualize virtual network traffic from VATSIM or IVAO and easily spot where to load in for the best coverage possible. â The all-new real-time traffic visualization will show online traffic on major networks and display highly useful information upon clicking on the aircraft, such as ETA, PIC, type, current airspeed, altitude, etc. Toggling the ATC sector info will also display all current active sectors with ATC on, revealing extra information upon interaction, such as frequencies, controllerâs name and rating, uptime, and more. Furthermore, they have also added a âgate availabilityâ system on the map to ensure you never load on top of another pilot again. The system even displays a handy list with all the available stands so that you donât have to do that work yourself. Navigraph has also mentioned they wonât stop there, with more to come in the future, and even subtly hint at a potential live traffic display on their built-in in-game panel for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Itâs already available for Navigraph subscribers on the appâs newest update. New subscribers can get the charts app and their updated navdata on their website.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In an announcement made on their website Wednesday, Microsoft addressed the delay in shipping the Limited Collectorâs Edition of the upcoming Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as well as outlining their plan to make sure customers are able to access FS24 on release, in just four days. For context, Aerosoft, the vendor for the Limited Collectorâs Edition, sent out an email to customers on Nov. 5, announcing that people who have pre-ordered the Limited Collectorâs Edition outside of the US before Nov. 6 can expect delays in shipping and delivery. However, U.S. customers will not be affected. You can read more about that here. Microsoft begins by thanking customers who pre-ordered the Limited Collectorâs Edition, and apologising, saying that they are âheartbroken that our shipping solution for regions outside of the United States have suffered an unexpected delayâ.They also confirm that Limited Collectorâs Edition pre-order customers outside of the U.S. can expect deliveries to start in the first week of December. To address these delays, Microsoft has announced a plan to ensure affected customers are able to play on release day, which is as follows: Additionally, when customers receive their Limited Collectorâs Edition package, they will have to redeem the code on the physical token provided for the Aviatorâs Edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to keep access to the sim. According to Microsoft, âAs long as you sign in with the same account when redeeming the token, then all your progress in the simulator will remainâ. They also posted a FAQ addressing inquiries from the community. As of the time of publication, pre-orders for the Limited Collectorâs Edition are still available on the Aerosoft Store for $259.99 USD. â If youâre wondering when FS24 will be available for you, check out our article covering release times for FS24.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. In a bombshell statement published on Wednesday, Amir Salehi, owner of Flightbeam Studios accused fellow scenery developer Alexey Unishkov, better known as Beautiful Model of the World (BMWorld), of distributing pirated addons from multiple developers, including Flightbeam themselves. This comes on the heels of BMWorld/AmSim's release of Washington Dulles.  As of the time of publication, multiple flight sim product vendors have pulled BMWorldâs products from their stores, including his products developed in collaboration with Pavel of AmSim. â Salehi details how he became suspicious of Unishkov, initially due to BMWorld/AmSim developing the same airports as Flightbeam, at around the same time. Then, a user on the AVSIM forums, going by the username of âPeter113â caught their attention, having few posts, with most of them being critical of Flightbeamâs products. Peter113 also posted screenshots comparing the BMWorld/AmSim rendition of KSFO to Flightbeamâs teasers of their rendition of the same airport. Threshold asked Salehi for comment on the identity of Peter113, and we were provided with a screenshot of the display name history for that user on AVSIM, which seems to indicate Peter113 was actually Pavel, frequent collaborator with Unishkov. Salehi continues on to his main point, saying that in September 2020, they identified and banned a user for distributing pirated files, specifically Flightbeamâs KPDX. Flightbeam achieved this by using a âtagâ unique to the userâs scenery files, and checking it against the pirated files. That user was, according to Salehi, none other than Unishkov. They confirmed that it really was Unishkov by matching the email he put up on his website in his earlier days of flight sim development. Salehi says that they âdiscovered this information in July 2024, [and] we patiently awaited the developersâ decision to move on, hoping that the situation would dissipateâ, but they are ânow confronted with an egregious display of unprofessionalism and toxicityâ. Umberto Colapicchioni, owner of FSDreamTeam, corroborated Salehiâs claims in a post on AVSIM, saying that Unishkov pirated products from them as well. Lars, founder of Contrail, added in the same forum thread that Unishkov was banned from Contrail for sharing a pirated copy of LatinVFRâs KMIA. â Unishkov took to the AVSIM forums on Thursday to respond to these allegations, saying âI GUARANTEE THAT I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PIRATE COMMUNITY AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PIRATE COMMUNITY!!!â He continues by decrying the actions of Salehi and others, claiming that they are âillegal accusationsâ, âdefame[d] my honor and dignityâ, and they âposted my personal data online without my consent, which is also illegalâ. Unishkov ends his statement by defending his work, stating âI put my soul into every airport!!!â, and âI ask the author of the accusations to go to court to prove my guilt or to delete posts that contradict the law, contain slander, insults, and also to delete my personal dataâ.  Pavel (AmSim) also posted a response on his Facebook page defending Unishkov, claiming âthe incident 4 years ago is not evidence of BMW's [Unishkovâs] involvement in the pirate communityâ. He also attacks the developers making the accusations, saying they âare trying to use dishonest methods of struggle [competition] against usâ, and that the situation is ânot at all about piracy (which does not really exist), but about the desire of competitors to kill our companyâ. â In response to the claims made by Salehi, Lars, and Colapicchioni, multiple vendors of flight sim products pulled BMWorld and AmSimâs sceneries from their storefronts, including iniBuilds, Orbx, and SIMMARKET. iniBuilds announced on their forums and Discord server Thursday that they have pulled BMWorldâs products from their store temporarily, until âthe situation is fully clarified and a definitive resolution is reachedâ, and that âthese allegations,â¦touch on issues we take very seriouslyâ. Orbx CEO Anna Cicognani stated in a forum post that âOrbx has decided to remove all BMW and BMW+AmSim products from its platforms due to a data protection breachâ, and they are âactively communicating with the developerâ. SIMMARKET posted on their Instagram announcing they have âtemporarily suspended sales of all products from BMWorldâ, due to âactivities involving alleged intellectual property infringementâ. All three said that existing BMWorld/AmSim customers will retain access to their products. â This situation is still evolving, and Threshold is committed to keeping you up to date with all the latest developments, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Statement on MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a statement on their Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 plans, including potential upgrade fees, the upcoming 777F, and future products. They claim to have been given access to the new platform, stating itâs a âspectacular platformâ with a visual quality never seen before, which gets them excited about what is to come. While singing high praises for MSFS 2024, they are unsure how long it will take to convert their product lineup, let alone gauge the amount of work required. Hiccups with the new platform are expected, as they have faced with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, and they will be âforgotten in no time once the fixes roll out.â âThe team at Asobo has incredible depth of skill and energy and they will come throughâ, concluded Randazzo. â Most of their development team is already running the new simulator. However, they have been unable to prove cross-compatibility with their MSFS2020 lineup, which is said not to be a surprise to them, nor unexpected. In other words, they do not yet have a clear picture of the state of their products against the new platform. â Compatibility-wise, Microsoft has been contacting PMDG to address minor issues with their 737 lineup, which Randazzo assumes has to do with their testing effort to ensure near-flawless cross-compatibility between the two platforms. â From the release of MSFS 2024 onwards, their products will fall into three categories: MSFS2020 only, MSFS2020/24, and MSFS 2024 only. The former means the product wonât function in 2024, the middle will mean it will load in the new simulator, albeit without any 2024-specific features, and the latter means it will only work in the new platform (747-400 and 747 Classic Whale, for example). â On whether their current product lineup will be updated to include MSFS 2024 features, Randazzo has said they plan on it, but they are still evaluating the SDK and how much work will need to be carried on for that to happen reasonably.Â  â Their provided list sheds some light on which of their add-ons will get special treatment: the 737, 77W, and all future products. The DC-6, on the other hand, might not get upgraded at all.Â  â While the 77W feature upgrade will be charged, Randazzo promises a small fee or none at all. The 737 lineup will get a modest upgrade charge, as itâs said to be receiving a significant upgrade. âThe 777F, rumored to be released in late October, is waiting on MSFS 2024 for compatibility testing. Their current plan is to release it for both platforms at no extra charge, but the âoption is on the tableâ to not release it for 2020 at all in exchange for greater featuresâand increased development timeâand platform singularity. â They will continue to support their MSFS 2020 product lineup, but their long-term strategy is to move all new development to the new simulator, meaning MSFS 2020 might not see any new releases. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on PMDG.com, ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Today is the day flight simmers around the world have been waiting for months to arrive. Microsoft has released its highly-anticipated follow up to their longest running, critically acclaimed franchise, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Developed in collaboration with French developer Asobo Studio, the new simulator includes many gamechanging features, and highly-requested community fixes from the previous version, in what Microsoft is calling âThe Most Ambitious Flight Sim Everâ.  Headlining features include the all-new Career system, 3D ground textures, first-person mode, overhauled weather and physics engines, and more, adding realism to their âdigital twinâ. Microsoft also claims that they have drastically reduced install size for this release, which was a widespread complaint about MSFS 2020, to around 30 gigabytes, compared to MSFS 2020âs gargantuan 300 gigabyte install with all World Updates installed. This has been enabled through Microsoftâs full embrace of cloud streaming through their Azure servers, putting most of the simulator in the cloud, including the entire in-sim Marketplace. With FS24, Microsoft and Asobo have broken new ground by collaborating with many developers who previously were primarily third-party developers, such as Orbx and iniBuilds. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the aircraft category, with 14 different development teams working on base aircraft for the simulator. However, itâs not just aircraft that are getting all the love, base systems have also gotten new features with every vertical obstacle being added in, as well as an Electronic Flight Bag with Charts, being developed by Orbx and Working Title respectively. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is available for purchase on both Steam and the MS Store, in four different editions, with Standard Edition on the low end, and Aviator Edition on the high end. The main differentiator between each edition is how many planes and handcrafted airports come as default, with the Standard Edition containing 70 default aircraft and 150 handcrafted airports, while the Aviator Edition contains 125 aircraft and 160 airports. (For a full breakdown, see our previous article about what each edition contains.) Standard Edition - $69.99 - Steam - MS Store Deluxe Edition - $99.99 - Steam - MS Store Premium Deluxe Edition - $139.99 - Steam - MS Store Aviator Edition - $199.99 - Steam - MS Store This release marks the turning of a new chapter in the flight simulation genre. With MSFS 2020 amassing 15 million players and with nearly 5,000 Marketplace creations over its lifetime, expectations are high for the new sim. The Threshold team are very excited about this new entrant into MSFS history and we will be sure to keep you all up to date with the latest news and high-quality reviews throughout this next chapter, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a video posted to their YouTube channel, Microsoft has released a launch day development update regarding the situation of the recently released Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Hosted by Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann, Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch, and Xbox Senior Community Manager Jayne Reynolds, the update comes as a response to many users who are experiencing issues while downloading the sim, such as software crashes, long download times, and missing default aircraft. Neumann starts off by stating that they âare really proud in what [sic] weâve accomplished with the simâ and they knew âthe excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024â, but he acknowledges that they underestimated the extent of the excitement for the new sim and that it âhas overwhelmed our infrastructureâ. Wloch says that they âhave been struggling for a few hours with one of our servicesâ and explains that the root cause of the issues has been a cache overflow in their servers. He goes further into detail, saying when âthey [Players] start, they areâ¦asking a server for some data, and that server is going to catch [sic] it in a databaseâ¦and that database is currently getting saturatedâ.  Wloch then describes what they have done to address the issue: âWeâve tried to restart the services, weâve taken measures to throttle the number of people who can come in [download],...and it worked well during [sic] maybe half an hour or so and then all of a sudden, the cache collapsed again so weâre restartingâ¦[and] trying to investigateâ. â Neumann continues by reassuring the community, acknowledging that they know âa lot of people are frustratedâ but they âwant to be as transparent and open as possibleâ, and adds that âthe team is on itâ. Finally, Reynolds concludes by thanking the community for all their feedback and that âWe appreciate each and every one of you, and weâll see you in the skies soonâ. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news and reviews!</summary>
