    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently issued a new update to their Boeing 737 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The update brings further stability fixes to the Universal Flight Tablet and fixes the broken pushback module from the previous build. The update is already available via the Operations Center for PMDG.com customers, whereas marketplace owners must wait until it goes through Microsoft's intake process. No changelog was provided with the update because of its tiny nature. They have also provided further information on their upcoming Boeing 777F for MSFS 2020 and 2024. As previously mentioned during their last development update, PMDG is unaware of how many changes will be required to function correctly in the new platform. As they waited for that to become clear, they sorted out issues related to the main deck cargo system and thoroughly tested items such as lighting and cargo door controls. It's said to be in great shape regarding operability, but they are taking their time to improve gameplay features they consider essential. In Randazzo's own words, streamers will receive their copy of the upcoming product "shortly." While part of their team works hard on the new triple seven variant, their 747 team is also hard at work on their new project, the Boeing 747-100 (and the -400). PMDG claims to have unprecedented access to a broad range of expertise, which will help make the 747 for MSFS their "lifetime project." They plan out on covering the entire 747 product line for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, with the initial entries being the aforementioned 747-100 and the 747-400, but other variants such as the 747SP are also in the plans, and even some special projects like the RA001, Air Force One, and the original test-flight bird. â It is intended to be a love letter to the iconic aircraft, with an enormous amount of effort being put into making it happen. Below is a work-in-progress image of the overhead panel: Their product is available on PMDG.com and in the Marketplace, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. TearWearDesigns recently released their rendition of Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (KXNA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. The airport serves Bentonville, Fayetteville, Springdale, and Rogers in Arkansas and has a yearly average of 1.9 million passengers. It opened in late 1998 to replace Fayetevilleâs Drake Field as the regionâs main airport, as the latter was deemed too small to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic demand. After nine years, the airport was expanded for the first time by constructing a new concourse, which increased the number of aircraft parking positions from twelve to twenty. In the 2010s, it was further expanded with an additional 4,700 square meters and twelve upper-level gates, which cost the administration around $21 million. A new concourse project was approved a few years ago. It will allow the airport to use the gates more efficiently and handle a higher passenger traffic volume. The cost estimate for the undertaking is around $35 million to $50 million. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date ground layout, 3D vegetation, hand-placed night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.98, requiring at least 1.04 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. iniBuilds has released its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator (both 2020 and 2024), featuring Innsbruck Airport (LOWI). This airport, known for its challenging approach, serves the Austrian city of Innsbruck, which is nestled between the Alps. Each year, Innsbruck Airport welcomes over 900.000 passengers. The airport opened in 1925 with the goal of connecting the city to Munich by air. However, it soon became evident how challenging it was to land and take off in an airport surrounded by mountains. The airport played a significant role during the Winter Olympics held in Innsbruck in 1964 and 1976. Over the years, the airport has undergone various upgrades and improvements, enhancing both its capacity and safety for travelers. Today, it offers a range of both year-round and seasonal routes, supported by airlines such as Austrian Airlines, easyJet, and Eurowings, among others. Last year, the airport served 900.000 passengers. The new rendition of Innsbruck Airport features hand-crafted ground textures, an authentic airport landside, dynamic lighting, highly detailed airport buildings, an official GSX profile, and much more. The scenery requires a total of 5.41 GB of storage space and is available for $19.48 on the iniBuilds Store.Â  For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Showcases Upcoming Sharklets Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fnxsha"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/672ad36ef2cdccb6b9a18c44_sharklets12.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Fenix Simulations has published an in-depth development update showcasing the upcoming sharklets update for their A320 family lineup (except for the A319). As promised in the past, it is said to be released "this week" for all customers at no extra cost. While the A320 and the A321 will be getting the sharklets from the get-go this week, the A319 will take a while. Fenix Simulations claims it's been a bit tricky to obtain reliable data on it, as not many exist in real life.Â  The sharklets are more than just a visual thing. Airbus went the extra mile to warrant similar handling and overall behavior between both variants, mostly on the "software" side of things, making it hardly noticeable if one doesn't look closely enough. Fenix Simulations claims to have accurately replicated the subtle system differences and flight dynamics behavior, warranting a realistic experience. The flight model has been adjusted to the sharklets, with a bit more lift on the wings, less drag, and extra energy on flare, which is said to be subtle but noticeable if you pay close attention. Regardless, the fly-by-wire system should make the overall handling feel relatively homogeneous across all variants, as in real life. As previously mentioned, there are also software changes, with upgrades to the two elevator and aileron computers, three spoiler elevator computers, and the two flight augmentation computers, as well as less significant changes to the ECAM, fuel, FMGC, and more.Â  Among these ELAC changes, Fenix Simulations highlights the Load Alleviation Function, which alleviates wing structure loading, as the extra weight of the sharklets also means more strain on the wings, making them bend more aggressively in extreme conditions. The LAF system rapidly deploys ailerons upwards while in-flight or spoilers 4 and 5 to prevent that. The FBW system was also tweaked to accommodate the new system and its inherencies. Ground physics also underwent improvements. The tiller mapping from the real A320 was applied to their add-on, adding a bit of extra weight to the taxi phase across their entire range of aircraft (wingtips included). They have also built a custom wingflex model to accommodate the more obvious sharklet wingflex, taking into account a lot of factors such as localized forces, fuel tank level, etc. It has also been backported to the wingtip fences. They also reinforce that it's mostly a work in progress and might not be perfect initially. The ADIRS model has been upgraded to the newer version, applying to both aircraft. The old one has been ultimately retired as it's rare in currently flying A320s anymore. The ACP was also upgraded, and the old one was phased out. They plan on bringing both the old ADIRS and ACP as options in the future. The new digital standby instrument has also been added as an integral - and forced - part of the sharklets modernization, complete with the correct degraded displays and its functions. At long last, the ACT tanks were also added to the A321, allowing for realistically operated transcontinental flights and routes like Finnair's HELâPMI. The presence of the ACTs also means less space in the cargo compartment, which is also modeled. The lights were heavily tweaked to match the configuration of most A320SLs, featuring a full LED suite across the aircraft. Regarding liveries, they have painted 106 unique liveries so far, with accurate cockpit configurations, ACTs (A321 only, of course), and more. The expected rollout date is sometime this week, and the discount on the full bundle will end once that happens. They conclude with a statement on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024: "Unfortunately, we were not permitted access to the DevAlpha (though we did ask Microsoft), which means we still don't have an answer for you on compatibility and timelines for adjusting to this new platform. Our intent will be to bring compatibility and stability first and foremost, then at a later time assess the new feature set and see what makes sense." Therefore, they found themselves unable to make any promises regarding dates, viability, or anything for that matter. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airfoillabs has recently announced the development of a high-fidelity Boeing 737 Max for X-Plane, featuring realistic flight dynamics, a detailed 3D cockpit environment, cockpit builder friendliness, and more. The development process will be completely transparent, with the developers providing frequent development updates on their X-Plane Org forum thread delineating every step taken into building the add-on. The updates will occur every month with detailed progress reports, media (screenshots and videos), technical deep dives, and clear milestone tracking with real-time progress indicators. They have already come up with an expected feature list for each release: alpha, beta, 1.0, and the future beyond that. The alpha release will implement the core flight dynamics, a detailed 3D cockpit environment, basic systems, and a relatively basic flight model. The beta release, on the other hand, should bring comprehensive aircraft systems, advanced autopilot functionality, initial FMS implementation, and the integration of the core systems. For 1.0, the aircraft should fully integrate all its systems, Â a custom EFB, a professional-grade sound environment, and complete documentation and manuals. â The aircraft should get regular updates based on community feedback, enhanced functionality releases, ongoing systems refinement, and advanced feature implementations post-release. â What they claim sets their 737 Max apart is that it's explicitly built for X-Plane's flight model engine, with a deep systems simulation focused on professional-grade accuracy. Thus, it's a potential platform for cockpit-building enthusiasts. â The development updates will start next Friday, with an in-depth look at their cockpit modeling progress. In the coming weeks, a real-time development tracker will be added to their website, where potential customers will be able to see its current development state. â Refer to their announcement post for further information on the matter.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. NZA Simulations has recently released their rendition of Wanaka Airport (NZWF) and its surroundings for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring over 5000 square kilometers of enhanced terrain, nine airports, and more. Wanaka Airport serves the town of Wanaka, in Otago, New Zealand, with a passenger average circling around the 5 digit mark (exact numbers are not available).Â  It was built in 1984 on top of a pre-existing private airstrip owned by Tim Wallis, a Kiwi businessman and aviation entrepreneur, ultimately replacing Mount Iron Aerodrome, which used to be Wanakaâs only airport and deemed too small for their plans back then. Air New Zealand started scheduled services in 2004, canceling them after only nine years due to low demand (which would only peak during airshow weekends). Local businesses rapidly stepped in to fill the gap, albeit unsuccessfully.Â  â In late 2020, SoundsAir started a scheduled service route to Christchurch airport, which is currently the airportâs only commercial traffic.Â  Other than the airport itself, the package also offers a 5000 square kilometer coverage around its surroundings, with nine airports in total, four helipads, 20+ mountain huts, 3D models, PBR texturing, high-resolution aerial imagery, 3D interiors for the main airport, Skydive Wanaka Hangar &amp; Customer area, Whare Kea Chalet Hut, Aspiring Helicopters, and Makarora Hangars. Below is a map with all the airports, airstrips, and landmarks included: Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $21.72, requiring at least 4.19 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In an email sent out to customers this week, Aerosoft has stated that orders for the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Collectorâs Edition have been delayed. Delays will affect orders made on Aerosoftâs EU Store, but orders made on their US Store will be delivered on schedule. According to the email, the delay has been caused by âunexpected shipping delays to our warehouse in Germanyâ. Aerosoft has not expanded on what specifically caused those delays. An exact timeline has not been given as of the time of writing, but they expect shipments to begin to customers âin the first week of Decemberâ. Aerosoft has further confirmed that activation codes will not be sent in advance of delivery on release day of FS24 on November 19th, but instead come delivered with the physical items, so simmers who bought the Collectorâs Edition in Europe will have to wait until their package arrives. As of the time of writing, Microsoft has not yet commented on the delays, but Threshold will keep you updated, so stay tuned!</summary>

    <title>A2A Simulations Publishes Statement on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. A2A Simulations has published a statement on its plans for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 development. The statement includes news on its Comanche 250 port for the new platform and its upcoming Aerostar 600. They have recently been granted access to the new SDK, and the Comanche 250 appears to work fine in MSFS 2024, with only a few issues requiring addressing, but Accu-Sim (the core system of their Comanche and all future planes) plays nicely with it. It should be available for the new simulator on day one or shortly after. A2A also said they will be providing assistance to transfer over the airframe state, files, and stuff to the new simulator when the time comes. Regarding fully bringing the Comanche to MSFS 2024 standards, itâs still under evaluation given the extra requirements for compliance, which has yet to be gauged whether it will be a lot of work. Therefore, no decision has been made yet about a native version for 2024. The 2020 version, though, should work in the new simulator just fine, albeit without the extra features that could be made possible with the latest SDK standards. They are still working on the Aerostar 600, albeit with the difference that the potential release date has been moved to 2025, as they need to reconsider their requirements for the new SDK. They reiterate aircraft development for MSFS is their top priority, and they plan on releasing more aircraft next year. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently released their own Document Center for their current product line. It features all of the documentation and support files, which are fully and freely available online with a wealth of content. Whereas they once used to be provided with the product files only, they will now be entirely available online, so Xbox and xCloud users can access the manuals from the comfort of any web-browsing capable device. Given its online nature, the manual can be updated much faster than usual, allowing them to quickly roll out any necessary changes or tweaks to their guides without requiring an actual aircraft update â or extra download â for that.Â  The manuals are available without a log-in wall, allowing potential customers to skim through them and judge the quality without committing to purchasing the aircraft. The Document Center is available through this link. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FSLabs Confirms Airbus A321-X for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67325a8b59834d034f96e79f_labus.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FSLabs recently confirmed the development and potential imminent release of their A321-X for Microsoft Flight Simulator after one of their forum members found a link to a new FSL webpage with references to the new product, which has yet to be officially announced.Â  Lefteris Kalamaras, FSLabsâ CEO, has confirmed the veracity of the leaked information and even attached two screenshots of the upcoming product. He also reiterated that some leaked information was merely placeholders and not representative of what would come. â FSLabs rose to fame in 2016 after releasing the first high-fidelity Airbus A320 add-on in history. This add-on allowed Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3d users to experience the day-to-day operation of one of the most popular airliners of all time, one that had not yet been developed to such standards (which quickly changed within five years). â While thereâs no official feature list or any other concrete information for the time being, the company is known for pushing the boundaries of realism with most of their products, and that might be the case with their first step into the ânewâ simulator.Â  â Itâs also unknown whether it will be available for MSFS 2020, 2024, or both. Threshold will ensure that you are covered should further information be revealed. â</summary>

    <title>BMWorld &amp; AmSim Release Washington Dulles International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/bmwiad"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67339250778ee59c56758176_iad1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. BMWorld and AmSim recently released their rendition of Washington Dulles International Airport (KIAD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Washington, D.C., with an average yearly of 25 million passengers. Opened in 1962, itâs one of the three major airports â and second busiest â serving the Metropolitan Washington Area, along with Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (KDCA) and Baltimore/Washington International Airport (KBWI).Â  The original design was tweaked for the first time in 1985 when it no longer suited its role as Washingtonâs main airport. Midfield concourses were constructed to facilitate walking between terminals for connecting flights and other such activities, consequently unclogging the main terminal. Concourses C and D were the first to be built, followed by A and B, with the former only reaching completion in 2004. Plans call for a new three-story south concourse covering 51,000 square meters in total area, ultimately replacing Concourse Aâs regional gates from the late 1990s. Itâs a hub for Southern Airways Express and United Airlines and served by Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Allegiant Air, All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, Turkish Airlines, United Express, Virgin Atlantic, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution custom ground textures, custom ground markings, an up-to-date airport layout, a detailed terminal area, animated jetways, fully modeled terminal interiors, and more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $21.09, requiring at least 1.58 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
