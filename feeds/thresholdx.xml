    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.2.0 Update</title>
    <updated>2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1222"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67ef0ee9572b607093dd0c18_lgt1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released a major update to X-Plane 12, which brings massive improvements to cloud rendering, lighting, environmental effects, and graphics performance. Their graphics team has been working to mitigate the famed dark cockpit issue, bringing significantly improved interior rendering quality. The light coming into the cockpit correctly follows the aircraft's contours and structural details. Furthermore, the graphics engine's exposure handling has also been improved, bringing exposure fusionâa familiar feature on most modern smartphonesâto the virtual realm of X-Plane 12. It consists of taking multiple photos at various levels of exposure and then automatically stitching them together, yielding a potentially impressive-looking result.Â  The sky brightness has also been tweaked to ensure it's more natural and doesn't burn people's retinas. Ground object brightness values have also been tweaked to ensure they are not overly bright. Their graphics engine as a whole has also undergone changes, with an upgrade to their shader compiler, which manages resources more efficiently and thus brings smoother performance figures. Texture handling has also been tweaked to ensure faster loading times and more efficient rendering. Their VRAM management method has also been tweaked, ensuring it prioritizes smaller memory requests before large ones, aiding total memory allocation. Additionally, it makes multiple attempts to allocate memory before giving up, allowing the system to free up space when needed and ultimately reduce the chances of blurry textures or slow performance overall. The cloud rendering system has also been changed, with a small radius surrounding the camera's viewport sporting high-quality clouds, nearly eliminating cloud pixelation effects around the airplane. They hint at it being a stepping stone to other cool rendering effects in the future. Last but not least, they have also changed how their light rendering system works by breaking them into tiles, yielding better performance in demanding environments such as large airports and cities. In addition, they have also made minor changes to colors, bringing more realistic color accuracy, improved sky rendering, better cloud shadows, cloud shadows on clouds, cloud-aware ambient light, and more realistic shadows overall. Detail has also been enhanced on surface textures around airports, and weather effects now also show outside of the airport's area, accumulating on main roads, as suggested by the community. â The complete changelog follows below: â Known Issues â Fixes and Enhancements General â Graphics â â Scenery â The update is currently available on the public_beta branch on Steam. Laminar customers can get the update by toggling âCheck for new betas as well as updatesâ.

    <title>Lata Voadora Releases Campo de Marte Airport for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Lata Voadora has recently released their rendition of Campo de Marte Airport (SBMT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the first airport ever to open in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Â  It was founded in 1929 (95 years ago), and its first few years were far from glorious: it was bombarded during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932. That did not stop it from having its commercial debut a year later, with scheduled flights to Sao Carlos and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Ribeirao Preto, and Uberaba. It was Sao Paulo's main airport until the opening of Congonhas Airport in 1936, which was bigger and less flood-prone (Campo de Marte had been flooded in 1929).Â  Nowadays, it mainly handles helicopters and general aviation and still hosts a nearly hundred-year-old flying club.Â  The traffic figures are around 60,000 aircraft operations per year, a massive drop from a decade ago when they reached almost twice that amount. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a high-detail model of the passenger terminal and its interior, custom landclass buildings, custom hangars, and much more. It's available on their website for roughly $7. Due to popular demand, an MSFS 2020-compatible version is in the works and set to be released by the end of the month.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlightSim Studio recently made an announcement on its Discord channel, providing a quick update on the forthcoming passenger version of their Boeing 727 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The developer revealed details regarding the release date, pricing, and more. The highly anticipated passenger version of the 727 is set to be released on April 17th, between 10:00 and 14:00 UTC. The aircraft will first be available at Aerosoft, followed by Contrail shortly after. Other stores will have it available in the next 1 to 2 weeks, and the in-Sim Marketplace is planned to launch in about 2 to 3 months. The price for the passenger version will be the same as the freighter version, set at approximately $45.45. The passenger version will be offered as a standalone add-on and does not require the freighter version. Customers who own the freighter version will receive a 20% crossgrade discount. For those inquiring about compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the team is actively addressing an issue where the APU fails to start. Once this problem is resolved, a free update will be released to ensure compatibility with the latest simulator. With the official release set for tomorrow, various streamers have already gained access to the aircraft, showcasing it for those interested in a sneak peek. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
