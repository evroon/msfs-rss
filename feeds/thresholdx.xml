    <summary>Sim: FS24. After several weeks of quiet development, BlueBird Simulations has moved its Boeing 757 into stage one of beta testing, the first time external testers have had access to the plane. In a brief message posted to their Discord server, BlueBird confirmed that while not every system is fully implemented yet, this new phase represents a significant step forward. BlueBird also posted a beta roadmap, outlining the three planned stages of the testing phase. BlueBird explained that this initial testing stage focuses on select systems, with external feedback now helping shape the aircraftâs refinement.Â  The team expects all three planned beta phases to take many months, stretching well into 2026, as they continue to polish systems and ensure stability across both MSFS 2020 and 2024. An in-depth update video and further screenshots are expected either later this year or shortly after the Christmas period. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has published a teaser image of their upcoming Boeing 737-800NG for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The image shows the progress on the cabin, which is ânot edited in any way, straight out of the sim,â they state. As previously announced, PMDG decided to bring a fully improved version of their 737NG lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 rather than just a compatibility patch. The new version includes a proper cabin, openable cockpit windows, and an overall quality bump on modeling and texturing, while also including MSFS 2024-only niceties such as the new walkaround mode. â Development has recently sped up after the developers were finally done with the 777 lineup, shifting their efforts to bring the 737NG to the new platform. Considering how prevalent the NG is in real-world operations, this is perhaps one of the most awaited updates thus far.Â  â â There is still no information on the release date or the pricing, but Threshold will keep you informed! â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has teased the progress on their v2.2 upgrade for the Fokker F28 Professional, which will land for free (for previous owners) on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 (PC and Xbox).Â  While they prioritized making it Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 nativeâallowing it to launch on the Marketplace for the first timeâthey also took the opportunity to improve the 2020 version, adding unique cabin branding for all the included liveries, with period-authentic touches, featuring some of the âboldâ design touches from the 1970s and 1980s. They will also include MSFS 2024âs pre-flight walkaround mode and a new EFB tablet model with a window-mount option. The complete 2.2 changelog and release information will be published very soon. In addition to the ongoing work on the F70/F100 and the F28, Just Flight is also hard at work on an update for the 146, which includes MSFS 2024 compatibility.

    <title>A2A Simulationsâ Accu-Sim Aerostar 600 Now MSFS 2020-compatible</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. A2A Simulations has recently released the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version of their Accu-Sim Aerostar 600, which was initially only compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. As previously mentioned on their previous development update on Discord, the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version of the Aerostar 600 doesnât bring full feature parity with the 2024 version due to limitations, such as the walkaround system, and dynamic wear and dirt visuals, but it includes the full Accu-sim fidelity and system depth aside from that.Â  The optional MSFS 2020 download is already available on the store page, and it is free for owners of the 2024 version.Â A fresh purchase warrants access to both versions. â The add-on is available on their website for $49.99.

    <title>Aerosoft and ToLiss Detail A340-600 Pro for MSFS in New Video</title>
    <updated>2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/at3401"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68e958a93b0e859a60623522_Baiix3leqhI-HD.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has initiated a developer video series for the Airbus A340-600 Pro, sharing the most in-depth look yet at the upcoming jet for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  In this first episode, community manager Rafi speaks with ToLiss founder Torsten Liesk, outlining how the collaboration splits responsibilities, how the flight model has been built, and what systems depth to expect. ToLiss is handling aircraft systems, avionics, custom flight and engine models, and flight logic. Aerosoft is responsible for the 3D model, visuals, and publishing. The teams say this plays to their strengths, complex Airbus systems from ToLiss, art and presentation from Aerosoft. Rather than porting code straight from X-Plane, ToLiss has spent two years creating new flight, ground, and engine models, tailored to MSFS, that behave similarly to X-Plane.Â  That includes workarounds for MSFS limitations, such as MSFS supporting only one aileron per wing, and a ground-handling model, developed with McGill University, to improve tyre friction, braking, and taxi dynamics. The behaviour has been validated by real-world A340-600 pilots, aiming to match the same feel of the X-Plane version. Systems are modelled at the component level, including pumps, valves, actuators, and reservoirs, so actions and failures produce natural downstream effects, rather than scripted outcomes. The team is targeting around 200â250 user-triggerable failures across hydraulics, electrics, pneumatics, flight controls, and engines. The FMS will include secondary flight plans, route offsets, temporary edits, and constraint-aware VNAV, with managed and selected modes. For long flights, a situation save/load system offers automatic saves at user-defined intervals, allowing recovery after crashes or convenient mid-route pauses.Â  A âjump to next waypointâ is also available, with time and fuel adjustments. Confirmed integrations include Hoppie CPDLC/ACARS and SimBrief flight-plan import. Navigraph support is under evaluation due to MSFS differences from X-Plane. Aerosoftâs video is the first in a series that will continue to show off progress, towards an eventual launch. There is no release date or pricing yet. Previously, the team also shared a video highlighting various systems and fault modes present within the A346. We will keep an eye on the weekly updates and share key developments as they land.

A custom flight model has also been built for MSFS 2024.Â  At launch, you get five liveries and an in-sim clipboard for simple crew setup. Optional modern avionics, a maintenance mode, additional liveries, and expanded crew tools are planned for the Early Access phase. MicroProse says updates will roll out on a frequent cadence, adding features consistently, ahead of the full release.Â  The B-17G is available now via Just Flight at an introductory price of US$32.99, rising to US$39.99 on full release. The download is about 3.2 GB. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold! If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds is heading far north, with a detailed rendition of Svalbard Airport, Longyear (ENSB), for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Billed as one of the worldâs northernmost commercial airports, this Arctic outpost will arrive pretty soon, with a launch price of $13,42, excluding sales tax. Operationally, ENSB links Svalbard to mainland Norway, with scheduled flights to Oslo and TromsÃ¸, as well as seasonal and charter services that support tourism and research. iniBuilds says the package captures the isolation and atmosphere of âpolarâ aviation, with custom ground textures across the airfield, bespoke night lighting, and carefully modelled landside areas, even including the famous Global Seed Vault on PlatÃ¥berget. Terminal interiors feature parallax and bespoke assets, and the airside environment is modelled with accurate ground clutter, signage, and static aircraft, including helicopters and a C172.Â The area surrounding the airport is also modelled. A custom GSX profile is included, and all models have LODs incorporated. Set against a collection of steep mountains, sea ice, and rapidly changing weather, Longyearbyen is the perfect place for fun approaches. Weâll keep you updated on its release.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. X-Crafts has just released version 2.1.0 of their E-Jets Family for XP12,Â  a free update that brings a fully integrated weather radar, a string of fixes and some quality-of-life tweaks.Â  Tied into XP12.3âs new precipitation data, the radar paints real returns on the PFD and MFD. v2.1.0 also smooths flight director behaviour after take-off, adds new HSI modes, including full compass, arc, and an arc-with-flight-plan option, and lets you hide the missed approach from the map. Cabin lighting bleed-through at night has been fixed, EFB crashes have been addressed, and overall compatibility with XP12.3 has been confirmed.Â  Looking ahead, X-Crafts is planning a free E-Jets 3.1 update, with the same radar tech and further map improvements, a new, from-the-ground-up ERJ Family 2.0 for XP12, and the next-gen, E-Jets Family 3.0. Whatâs New in v2.1.0 You can download v2.1.0 via SkunkCrafts or by re-downloading from your store account. New customers can purchase the E-Jets in various single and bundle deals, ranging from $74.95 to $149.95. For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!
