    <summary>Sim: MSFS. CloudSurf Asia has recently released its version of Puerto Princesa International Airport (RPVP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Located in the province of Palawan, Philippines, the airport serves the area of Puerto Princesa. The airport welcomes just over 1.1 million passengers annually. Built by American prisoners of war during the Second World War, the airport was under construction from 1942 to 1944. After completion, the airport was used by Japanese transport aircraft alongside a former grass airstrip located near today's NCCC Mall Palawan. After the liberation of Palawan in 1945, various units from the US Army Air Forces were stationed at the airport. It wasn't until 1947 that Puerto Princesa opened and started with air travel. Since then, the airport has seen a variety of airlines and aircraft, and has also undergone several expansions and improvements due to the increasing demand for air transportation. Today, the airport is an operating base for Air Juan and serves airlines such as Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines, and Philippines Air Asia, with nearly 9000 aircraft movements and around 1.1 million passengers yearly. The newly released Puerto Princesa International Airport for MSFS includes a variety of features such as up-to-date airport data, a fully modeled terminal with an interior, full custom objects around the airport, custom ground markings, full PBR textures, and more.Â  The add-on requires a total of 0.99 GB of storage space and is now available on Orbx, SimMarket, and iniBuilds for approximately $15.00. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Dreamflight has just released its version of Jackson Hole Airport (KJAC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the valley of Jackson Hole, located in the U.S. state of Wyoming, and welcomes just under 1 million passengers annually. The airport was constructed in the 1930s after it was determined that the chosen location would be the best place for an airport in Teton County. In 1943, the airport was designated as a national monument and in 1950 it was incorporated into the Grand Teton National Park. In 1959, the runway was extended to a length of 6,300 feet, which remains the same today. That year, Frontier Airlines became the first airline to operate at the airport. Between 2009 and 2014, the airport's terminal was completely rebuilt and received the American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 2014. Additional improvements were initiated in 2021 and 2022. Currently, the airport serves a variety of airlines such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and more, which collectively facilitate the annual arrival of around 1 million passengers. The newly released Jackson Hole Airport scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator includes a range of features, such as an accurate representation of the airport, high-quality textures, detailed models, fully detailed interior, custom ground polynomials, realistic night lighting, PBR textures, GSX profile, and more. The entire scenery package requires 1.79 GB of storage space and can be purchased on Contrail for approximately $16.38. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently announced the development and imminent release of Naha Airport (ROAH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Okinawa Prefecture with a yearly average of 21.5 million passengers. The Imperial Japanese Army built the airport in 1933 as Oroku Aerodrome. The United States took it over in 1945, and it was renamed Naha Airport. Scheduled service started two years later with Pan American World Airways and Northwest Orient.Â  â Refurbishment work began in the early 1950s, bringing the structure up to the standards of the time. â In the early 1980s, the US military transferred control of the airport to the Japanese forces, which then developed the airport. The first major upgrade happened in the 1990s, with a main passenger terminal expansion.Â  â Further development started in 2008 when the government agreed to expand the domestic terminal and construct a new parallel runway. The expansion required a new international terminal, which opened in 2014, and the construction of the new parallel runway started around that same year. The new international terminal was expanded again in 2016, gaining another 3000 square meters.Â  â The new runway started operation in 2020 after nearly six years of construction. â Itâs a hub for Japan Transocean Air and Ryukyu Air Commuter and a focus city for All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, and Peach. Air China, Asiana Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, EVA Air, HK Express, Hong Kong Airlines, Jeju Air, Jetstar Asia, Juneyao Air, Korean Air, Spring Airlines, Starlux Airlines, and Tigerair Taiwan also serve it. â The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with a highly detailed terminal, various POIs, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom vehicle models, custom runway profile and elevation data, a high-quality terminal interior, custom taxiway labels, and more. Thereâs no information on pricing yet, but the scenery is set to release sometime next week.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 has just released its latest airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Cornwall Airport Newquay (EGHQ). Located in England, the airport serves the areas of Newquay and Cornwall. Annually, the airport welcomes just over 400,000 passengers. The airport opened in 1933 as a civilian airfield. When the Second World War broke out, the airport was renamed RAF Trebelzue, and it was used to support other bases in the Cornwall area. In 1943, the airfield was renamed RAF St Mawgan and was handed over to the USAAF. After being put under maintenance in 1947, the airport reopened in 1951 as a Coastal Command base. Since then, various aircraft squadrons have operated at the airport, but those operations have since ceased. From 2006, a series of changes and upgrades gradually transformed the airport into a fully civilian airport. In 2008, the airport was officially separated from RAF St Mawgan and rebranded as Cornwall Airport Newquay. Today, the airport serves various airlines such as easyJet, Loganair, and Ryanair, and it is also a hub for the airline Eastern Airways. These airlines, along with others, contribute to the airport's annual 400,000 passengers and just over 19,000 aircraft movements. The scenery offers a range of features, including detailed buildings, realistic ground markings, high-resolution ground imagery, night effects, airport vehicles, vegetation, PBR materials, static aircraft, and more. The newly released Cornwall Airport Newquay is now available on SimMarket for approximately $16.46. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Rafael Tango Tango has recently released their rendition of Recife/GuararapesâGilberto Freyre International Airport (SBRF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Recife in Pernambuco, Brazil, with a yearly average of 9 million passengers. It was built during World War 2 to replace an airfield at the same location. In the years following the conflict, it became a strategic technical and refueling stop on routes from South America to Europe. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 1958, and its two runways at the time were extended to accommodate larger aircraft. In the late 1970s, an agreement was reached with Infraero (a state-owned airport operator) to develop the airport further, which led to a renovation in 1982 and expansion work in the 1990s. A new passenger terminal, including a new shopping mall and a new concourse, was built in 2004, increasing its passenger handling capabilities from 1.5 million a year to 9 million. In late 2009, the government invested 8 million BRL into upgrading the terminal for the 2014 World Cup, adding eight more jetways and modernizing the infrastructure. Itâs a hub for Azul Linhas AÃ©reas and is served by Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, LATAM Brasil, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, a custom 3D-modeled passenger terminal, custom jetways, custom autogen for the city, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $6.55, requiring at least 263.59 MB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations has recently released their rendition of VitÃ³ria âEurico de Aguiar Salles International Airport (SBVT) and its surroundings for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves VitÃ³ria in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 3.2 million passengers. Originally built in the 1930s, it would not receive its first passenger terminal and paved runway until a decade later. Heavy renovation work, including a new passenger terminal and runway, was carried out in 2005. Although scheduled to be completed in 2007, several scandals led to a "temporary" halt for nearly a decade. Construction work only resumed in 2015 and concluded three years later, in 2018, sixteen years after the original planning.Â  A few years before the resumption of the expansion works, the airport's operator, Infraero, deemed it the country's worst airport. âOperated by Zurich Airports AG since 2019, the new airport finally meets international standards and swiftly leaves its dark past behind. Azul (Belo Horizonte, Campinas, Recife), Gol (BrasÃ­lia, Porto Seguro, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, SÃ£o Paulo), Latam (BrasÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo), and Voepass (Porto Seguro) serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a highly detailed terminal, city POIs, custom ground clutter, custom ambient sounds, custom terraforming, and more. It's available in the MSFS Marketplace for roughly $8.99 (on sale for $6.49).Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
