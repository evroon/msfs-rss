    <title>FlyDesign Releases Krakow-Balice Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlyDesign has recently released their rendition of John Paul International Krakow-Balice Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, serving KrakÃ³w, Poland, with a yearly average of 11 million passengers.Â  Its construction started in 1964, opening for civil aviation three years later, in 1967. A passenger terminal was only built four years after its civil opening. The 1970s brought further development work to accommodate larger aircraft: a longer runway, new taxiways, and high-intensity runway lights. A new terminal was inaugurated in the late 1980s after the authorities deemed the actual capacity to be subpar compared to the projected traffic figures for the upcoming decade. Thus, it was inaugurated in 1993, followed by apron upgrades in 1995. New modernization work was carried out in 2002, focusing on improving the international passenger experience. Such effort was not in vain, and international routes increased in the following years. A separate domestic terminal (Terminal 2) was opened in 2007, and at the time, plans were underway to build an entirely new terminal in addition to Terminal 2. Ryanair opened their second Polish base in KrakÃ³w in 2012, basing two 737-800 aircraft there and connecting KrakÃ³w to many destinations across Europe.Â  Krakow-Balice became the first regional airport in Poland to reach over 9 million passengers yearly in 2023.Â  â â Due to the recent increase in traffic, the authorities have announced an upgrade plan to build a new terminal. The current terminal is not large enough to meet the projected demand for the future. â Itâs a focus city for Buzz Air (Ryanair Poland), Wizz Air, and LOT Polish Airlines. Aegean Airlines, airBaltic, Air France, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Swiss, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution ground textures, hand-placed vegetation, fully dynamic lighting, high-definition buildings, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $22.00, requiring at least 924.68 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>SiamFlight Releases Phuket International Airport for MSFS 2020</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SiamFlight recently released their rendition of Phuket International Airport (VTSP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves the island of Phuket, Thailand, and has a yearly average of 17.2 million passengers, making it the third busiest airport in Thailand. Built in 1988 to accommodate only 6.5 million passengers yearly, it operated nearly at capacity for almost 30 years, until a new expansion project brought the figures to 20 million passengers per year (12.5 million passengers on the new terminal, 6.5 on the old one). It currently has three terminals: Terminal 2 handles international flights, Terminal 3 handles domestic operations, and Terminal X exclusively handles charters. Due to space constraints, Phuket has reached its capacity limit, which led the authorities to consider a rail link to Krabi International Airport for traffic alleviation in the near â or distant â future. In addition to the link, thereâs a plan to build an entirely new airport elsewhere to serve Phang Nga, Phuket, and Krabi. It was supposed to be a multi-phase project, with phase one to start in 2022 and reach completion by 2025, but everything was indefinitely put on hold.Â  Itâs a focus city for Thai Airways International and an operating base for Bangkok Airways, Thai Lion Air, and Thai AirAsia. Aeroflot, Air Arabia,Â  Air China, Air India, Azur Air, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Condor, Emirates, HK Express, IndiGo, Jetstar, Korean Air, Mahan Air, Nok Air, Qatar Airways, Scoot, Singapore Airlines, TUI, and Turkish Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terminals with an interior, custom ground textures, custom jetways, landside buildings, hand-placed taxiway guidance signs, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $21.38, requiring at least 196.68 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has released Emerald Airport (YEML), developed by Rob Byrne, for MSFS 2020 and 2024. Emerald Airport is situated in the Central Highlands region of Queensland, Australia, approximately 6 km south of Emerald, the main town it serves. QantasLink, Virgin Australia Regional, and Alliance Airlines operate an average of 54 return flights to Brisbane every week. The area is sparsely populated, with fewer than two inhabitants per square kilometre. Additionally, it experiences very little rainfall, averaging around 830 millimetres of precipitation per year. Orbx says Emerald Airport for MSFS offers detailed exteriors and interiors of its terminals. The airport features subtle terraforming, with night lighting for both the terminal and aprons, as well as custom ground markings. There is also custom lighting on the runway, taxiway, and aprons. â In addition, the airport includes a detailed helicopter hangar, general aviation hangars, fuel facilities, and functioning anemometers that respond to changes in wind speed. â A full feature list follows: The scenery can be purchased for $16.36 at the Orbx store and is compatible with both MSFS 2020 and 2024. â Stay tuned to Threshold for news, reviews, and more.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PhotoRico has recently released their rendition of Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020/2024. The airport serves the municipality of San Juan in Puerto Rico and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers. Constructed by the US Navy in 1929 as Naval Station Isla Grande, it served as Puerto Ricoâs main international gateway until 1954, when it was ultimately replaced by Isla Verde International Airport. All international airlines moved there shortly after. The airportâs future was questioned a few times in the early 2000s, but a definitiveâfavorableâdecision was eventually reached in 2006 due to its key function as a primary reliever for Puerto Ricoâs main airport. In early 2011, the airportâs future went through another scare: the FAA wanted to close the airportâs control tower because they operated it themselves and intended to cut costs. Air Flamenco, Fly the Whale, M&amp;N Aviation, and Vieques Air Link regularly serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail buildings, custom ground textures, detailed landside, real static GA aircraft, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $12.70, requiring at least 873.59 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx recently released their rendition of Sandane Airport (ENSD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The airport serves the village of Sandane in Norway and has a yearly average of 37,000 passengers.Â  The airport was built in the early 1970s and opened in 1975, then the only airport serving the district of Nordfjord. Due to its geography and low regularity, its initial years were plagued by severe turbulence, which was eventually partially mitigated in the following decades by a terminal expansion and a runway extension. The regularity issue was addressed relatively recently by installing navigation systems, ultimately reducing the canceled flights to a mere 5% in 2022. Its pre-ILS days were rather grim, with airplanes often dealing with low visibility, extreme winds, and insufficient runway. Itâs served by WiderÃ¸e, which has obligatory public service flights to Bergen, Oslo, and Sogndal, flown with Dash 8-100 airplanes. The Norwegian government subsidizes all of the routes. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 2K PBR textures, custom ground decals, crisp orthoimagery, custom approach lighting and ground equipment, and more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $11.97, requiring at least 842.51 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Salvuz recently released their rendition of Bergen Airport (ENBR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It is the second busiest airport in Norway, with a yearly average of 6 million passengers. Dating back to the early 1950s, Bergen Airport was partially funded by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana with 4 million Norwegian kroner, securing the construction of a terminal and a 1,460-meter-long runway. NATO funded an expansion in 1953, warranting a 2,440-meter-long runway instead. When the first flight landed at the airport in mid-1954, only 800 meters were complete. It was a chartered flight from Bergen to Oslo, transporting a local football team. Itâs a hub for Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e, with an extensive domestic and intra-European network. According to 2014 data, Scandinavian Airlines had 46% of the market share for domestic flights, Norwegian had 38%, and WiderÃ¸e 15%. Internationally, Norway led the way with 36%, SAS with 23%, and KLM with 18% (with a single route to Amsterdam).Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with highly detailed buildings, high-resolution PBR textures, custom jetways, an up-to-date layout (as of 2024), and it also supports MSFS 24âs new lighting and LOD system. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.85, requiring at least 1.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

The plane will feature all three engine variants (GE, RR, and PW) with their correct performance figures, indications, and sounds.Â  â While there is no timeline for the beta testing phase to end, Randazzo suspects they will have a better feel for the qualitative state of the product in the next 7-10 days. â Like the 777F, the 777-200ER will be available for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 first, with a 2024 version to be released later. â PMDG has also announced a new Operations Center (3.0), which is currently under beta testing as well and will eventually replace their current Operations Center, sporting a fresh new look, the ability to manage all product installations from within it, update management, rollbacks, and multiple channels (stable, experimental, beta, streamer builds). It will also handle activation and install rights and significantly improve PMDGâs ability to diagnose and resolve any problems that might occur with their products at hand.Â  Furthermore, the new Operations Center will eliminate the need for installers, which used to be one of their biggest choke points during product releases. â Itâs scheduled to roll out soon and coexist with 2.0 until they are wholly comfortable with the new methods. â Regarding the status of the 777âs conversion to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, PMDG has managed to build its lineup inside the new platform with great success, but some stability issues were found that would ultimately break the experience.Â  Despite the slightly underwhelming results, PMDG remains optimistic that their ârelationshipâ with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will improve as Asobo updates the platform. â On the other hand, the DCâ6â which they assumed would be an easy conversionâhas proven to be one of the trickiest, with numerous problems with the animations (including cockpit controls, levers, buttons, and other items). They have been unable to determine what is causing the problem so far. â They have reported the issue in Asoboâs dev community forums, but it appears to have not caught their attention yet, and no other developer has encountered anything similar. In light of this, PMDG has provided no ETA for its eventual conversion to the new platform. â 737NG-wise, they have not yet evaluated it in the new platform, as they are using the 777 as a testbed to learn the ropes. As for the upgrade pricing, PMDGâs position remains the same: while they ideally do not want to charge, they might have to charge depending on the amount of work required (they havenât fully gauged how much effort will be necessary yet). â Work on the 747 fleet has been accelerating while everything else remains relatively stagnant due to the compatibility stalemate. Randazzo reiterates that things are still moving, though slowly.Â  â While the 747-400 doesnât have any images yet, they have shared two pictures of the flight deck work on the 747-100, showcasing the newly started labeling work, custom weathering, etc.Â  Coding is also progressing nicely, with PMDG taking full advantage of the âstalemateâ to move developers on and off the 747. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their official website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99 If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Parallel 42 Publishes Deep Dive Video on Upcoming ChasePlane for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2025-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Parallel 42 recently published a video on their YouTube channel showcasing ChasePlaneâs onboarding tutorial. The video walks you through setting up all the necessary items to get the best experience and provides further information on the optional community access. The 10-minute video covers the entirety of the introductory steps, walking you through removing your bindings in Microsoft Flight Simulator (ChasePlane âkidnapsâ the camera system), configuring your bindings, setting up different camera presets, enabling cinematics, and sharing views with the community. â Itâs important to note thatâunlike Flow, one of their best-selling products for MSFSâcloud storage canât be provided for free, as it takes significantly more space. Therefore, they have chosen to make the cost optional, lowering the productâs final price tag and allowing customers to decide whether they want to pay extra for community access. The prices for community access range from 5 dollars for the yearly subscription to 20 dollars for a lifetime.Â  â P42 also reiterates that community access is NOT needed to share camera views, as they have built powerful importing and exporting methods that allow you to share camera views via any platform outside of their community ecosystem. â Refer to this blog post for further information on the optional community access system.
