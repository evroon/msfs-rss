    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently issued another update to their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, improving core areas, fixing bugs, and adding larger new items. The VNAV system underwent a major overhaul, with improvements to vertical profile adherence and constraint handling, as well as the addition of Constant Mach Segments, Continuous Descent Approach, and Estimated Take-off Time.Â  Furthermore, iniBuilds has also added dynamic icing and snow effects, GSX integration for de-icing, and hot brake disc visuals on both platforms.Â  The ECAM system also expanded with new fuel, icing, braking, and thrust logic alerts. They have also done audio work to refine the cabin ambience, engine dynamics, and touchdown feedback, aiming to close the gap between their virtual rendition and the real thing. Optimization work was carried out under the hood to warrant better performance, with code cleanups and restructuring reducing the overhead and thus improving the framerate.Â  The complete changelog for the update follows below: v1.0.9Systems &amp; EFB âï¸ð¥ï¸Added: CDA implementationAdded: ETT ImplementationAdded: CMS (Constant Mach Segment)Added: HCF Taxi implementationFixed: FMS sequencing when selecting arrival runwayFixed: BATC ATC auto tuningFixed: Aircraft unable to level off after autosaveFixed: Manual MAN TOGA thrust limit revisedFixed: Autosave -

    <title>flyt Releases Afonso Pena International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. flyt has recently released their rendition of Afonso Pena International Airport (SBCT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Curitiba, Brazil, with a yearly average of 5.1 million passengers. It was built by the Brazilian Air Force Ministry in partnership with the United States Army during World War 2, although it never really served its âwartime purposeâ because it was completed only in 1945, as the lights were already going out on the battlefield.Â  Within a year of its completion, the airport was dedicated as a civil airport, which it has consistently been. The first passenger terminal remained in use until 1959, when a replacement one was built. It remained in use for nearly 40 years, until it was replaced by a much larger one in 1996. The old terminal was then converted into a cargo terminal. The airport was upgraded in 2009 during the governmentâs effort to bring all the major airports up to modern standards for the World Cup (2014). The government spent 30 million BRL on enlarged aprons, new taxiways, and better parking infrastructure. Itâs a focus city for Azul, and served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Gol Linhas AÃ©reas, JetSmart Chile, LATAM Brazil, LATAM Chile, and LATAM Peru. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom terminal interior, custom ground service equipment, an up-to-date ground layout, and much more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $12.99 (both platforms). If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>iBlueYonder Publishes Trailer for Upcoming Dallas Love Field for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68150eebd242e9706093cee7_yonder9.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. iBlueYonder has recently published a trailer for their upcoming Dallas Love Field (KDAL) for X-Plane 12, developed in partnership with StableSystem and joshomoore (they handled the porting process, as the scenery was originally made for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020). Dallas Love Field is the 31st busiest airport in the United States, with a yearly average of 6 million passengers, opened 105 years ago as a training camp for WW1 pilots and then converted into a storage facility for surplus aircraft right after the war, where it barely saw any action for nearly ten years. It was then purchased by the city of Dallas in 1928 and opened for civilian use, with the first set of paved runways to come four years later.Â  The first proper terminal was built in 1940, serving 21 weekday airline departures from American, Braniff, and Delta.Â  World War 2 forced the airport to return to its training school roots, only ceasing after it was all over when it once again returned to being a civil airport.Â  With the increased passenger numbers during the late 1950s came the need for a new terminal (T3) designed by Donald S. Nelson. It would have three concourses, 26 gates, and the worldâs first moving walkways.Â  Nowadays, the airport has a single terminal with 20 gates, with Alaska and Delta Air Lines having one each, and the remaining 18 are under Southwestâs helm. Not coincidentally, Southwest Airlines has 95.3% of the passenger market share, followed by Delta with 2.2% and Alaska with 1.7%. Houston (387,000), Denver (367,000), and Atlanta (358,000) compose the top list of busiest destinations from Love Field. While an official feature list hasnât been revealed yet, its ported nature probably means it wonât differ much from the original, which features custom ground textures, a high-detail terminal model with its interior, hand-crafted and hand-placed signage, custom night lighting, and more. Thereâs yet to be any information on pricing or a release date, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. KiwiFlightSim has recently released their rendition of Faleolo International Airport (NSFA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Apia, in Samoa. The United States Navy built it in the 1940s on land reclaimed by the New Zealand colonial administration as an airfield and naval base. The original runway was only 1,200 meters long, but it eventually expanded to 1,829 meters in 1943 to accommodate larger fighter jets. After the war, the airport became relatively underutilized, only seeing proper traffic after an upgrade in 1957 that allowed the conversion from seaplanes to land-based aircraft. An upgrade followed in the 1970s to create a 1,700-meter-long sealed runway less vulnerable to floods (common in the region). The new addition would allow larger jets like the Boeing 737 to fly into the airport. Further upgrades followed in the mid-1980s and early 2000s to make it able to handle even larger jet aircraft. Air New Zealand, Fiji Airways, Qantas, Samoa Airways, Talofa Airways, and Virgin Australia serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a 3D modeled main terminal and its interior (plus VIP terminal, regional terminal, and tower, all with their respective interiors), custom night lighting, custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom GSX profile, and much more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.33, requiring at least 1.39 GB of free hard disk space to install.

Opened in 1917, the airport initially served as a training base for the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. Following the war, it continued as a military air base until the City of Dallas purchased it in 1927, marking the beginning of civilian operations, with commercial flights starting shortly thereafter. During World War II, the airport was again utilized by the military. After the war, commercial traffic at the airport saw significant growth. Over the years, the airport has undergone various expansions and improvements. Today, it operates as a base for Southwest Airlines and JSX while also serving Delta Airlines. These airlines facilitate nearly 250,000 aircraft operations each year, handling over 16 million passengers. The scenery includes features such as a complete representation of the airport, a skyline of Dallas City, a detailed terminal interior, custom night lighting, hand-placed vegetation, and more. The newly released scenery is now available from SimMarket for approximately $21.16. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a new development update concerning the arrival of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs Sim Update 2 and what it means to their product line and upcoming updates. According to Robert Randazzo, the update caught them off guard as they were preparing an update to make the 777F compatible with 24 and another update for the newly released 777-200ER (for both platforms). They were already getting the cloud services to distribute the files, but SU2 has temporarily halted it. The new SDK changes with SU 2 introduce a bunch of auditing features that threw many warnings on their 777, which they had to spend plenty of time (until this morning) fixing. However, as they donât want any extra surprises, it was decided that it would be best to send the update over to the testing team to make sure everything is okay before actually rolling out an update. â They anticipate the 777F going live on Monday for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024; the same applies to the 777-200ER update. â The 777-300ER update for MSFS 2024 is still on track for next week, even though they ran into this little roadblock with the 777F. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Verticalsim Releases Southwest Florida International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Southwest Florida International Airport (KRSW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Fort Myers and Southwest Florida and has a yearly average of 11 million passengers. RSW was built to replace Fort Myers' former main airport, Page Field, as it was considered too small and difficult to expand due to certain constraints (like a major highway, for example), starting anew elsewhere seemed the better idea. Construction started in 1980, and the airport was inaugurated on schedule three years later. It featured an 8400-foot runway and a terminal with 14 gates on two concourses. In 1993, a 50,000-square-foot Federal Inspection facility was annexed to the main concourse, and the runway was lengthened to 12,000 feet to better accommodate international service. The terminal underwent expansion in 1998 to keep up with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel. A new wing and three additional gates were added to Concourse B. An entirely new terminal project, with three concourses and 28 gates, started in 2002. Part of the original terminal had to be demolished to make room for the new one. It's an operating base for Breeze Airways, and served by Air Canada Rouge, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Discover Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Porter Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, an official GSX profile, custom high-grade aerial imagery, basic interiors for performance, and much more. It's available on Contrail for roughly $18.00, requiring at least 3.82 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDGâs Boeing 777F Now Available for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-05-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/77f519"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67536d0cda476a2b5d5c3f25_frei5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently made its Boeing 777F fully compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which is now available through the new Operations Center for 2020 owners. After a few days of struggling with SU 2 (as per their last development update), PMDG has finally managed to get the 777F working properly in the new simulator. It is the first of the pre-2024 777s to get compatibility.Â  Owners of the 2020 version do not need to repurchase the addon, and new purchases will grant you the two versions. Furthermore, PMDG will submit the 777F to the in-game marketplace for intake, a process that is known to take a couple of weeks. The 2020 version also got an update, as it hasnât been updated in a while, thanks to PMDG being busy with the 777-200ER. The changes include code optimizations, flight model and fly-by-wire improvements, systems updates, and bug fixes, along with new features such as the weight and balance application, and the inclusion of the SayIntentions datalink integration to both the 777-200ER and the 777F.Â  The 777-300ER is currently in testing for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and might become available later this week, but that will require further evaluation, and it is possible that it will only be ready next week. Regarding their next product, the 777L is being prepared for entry into testing, and they expect that to begin by the end of May. The addon is available at their store for $54.99.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <title>Navigraph Updates SimBrief With New Planning Tools</title>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph recently issued an update to its flight planning tool, SimBrief, adding an advanced thunderstorm avoidance system, a new route calculation engine, and more. SimBriefâs latest versionâsubscriber-only, thoughâadded a wealth of features that, according to Navigraph, beat real-life dispatching tools even before the update.Â  With their all-new route calculator, itâs now possible to avoid specific SIGMETs along the way and plan a path around the weather. Furthermore, avoiding temporary flight restriction or ETOPS areas is also a breeze. ETOPS area avoidance makes it easier for people intending to replicate certain ferry flights on non-ETOPS-certified airplanes, providing them with a realistic and safe route.Â  In addition to these new features, you can now easily add oceanic tracks, instantly preview the route before its generation, choose specific SIDs and STARs from a dropdown list on the route calculator, and visualize them on the interactive map before ultimately picking one. â Non-subscribers have not been forgotten, and they received three new updates: a flight history overhaul, expanded aircraft options, and easier equipment editing. â The update is available right now and accessible through their website or app. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MXI Design has recently launched its version of Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Serving as Istanbul's secondary international airport, it is also the second busiest airport in Turkey, accommodating over 41 million passengers each year. The airport opened in 2001, created to accommodate the growing number of both domestic and international passengers that AtatÃ¼rk Airport could no longer handle. Construction of a new terminal began in 2008 and was completed in 2009. In 2023, the airport added a second runway, and there are plans to build new passenger terminals between the two runways. Today, the airport serves over 41 million passengers annually, facilitated by more than 240,000 aircraft movements. It operates as a hub for AJet and Pegasus Airlines, while also serving airlines such as British Airways, Flydubai, Qatar Airways, and many others. The newly released scenery features high-resolution PBR textures and modelling, interior modelling, custom jetways, an up-to-date airport layout, a custom GSX profile, and much more. MXI Design's version of Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport is now available on Contrail for approximately $27.28. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
