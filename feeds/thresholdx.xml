    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has released update 12.2.0 after a few months of beta testing. This update brings a major graphics overhaul to their latest flight simulator, with new clouds, new tone mapping for lighting, and much more. First launched on alpha in March 2025, update 12.2.0 was finally deemed mature enough to enter the release channel. It brings a wealth of improvements to the simulatorâs visuals and overall performance and fixes long-standing issues, such as the dark cockpits, which are no longer a problem. Furthermore, the update also overhauls the cloud rendering system, making it more efficient and closer to reality. The changes to the sky donât change there, with tonemapping tweaks and atmospheric rendering improvements that bring better sky colors and cloud shadows. The simulatorâs stability has improved significantly, resulting in a more consistent experience. Airport ground textures have also been revamped, with crisper markings all around.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has just released its latest scenery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This time, the team focused on the Greek island of Samos, specifically Samos International Airport (LGSM). Annually, the airport welcomes nearly 500,000 passengers looking for the Greek sun. Opened nearly 50 years ago in 1976, the airport has a long history. The terminal underwent renovation in the late 1990s, which significantly increased its capacity to handle passengers. The airport is known for its challenging approach due to its surroundings and strong winds. Today, it is served by airlines such as Aegean Airlines, Jet2.com, Scandinavian Airlines, Sky Express, and TUI fly Nordic, providing flights to various destinations across Europe, including Athens, London, Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm, among others. With nearly 6,000 aircraft movements each year, the airport accommodates just under 500,000 passengers annually. The scenery features an accurate 3D model of the terminal and control tower, realistic terrain with slope adaptation, custom vegetation, enhanced night lighting, high-resolution textures using PBR implementation, and much more. The newly released Samos International Airport, developed by MM Simulation, is now available from Orbx for approximately $18.60. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>FlightFX's C750 to Release in July for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-06-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/ffxjul"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/685def6f7d4378fb1e58c875_citation1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FlightFX has finally set a release date for their upcoming C750 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. It will be available in peopleâs virtual hangars on July 10 as an MSFS Marketplace exclusive. âAfter countless late nights, endless reworks, a few are we there yet moments, and more caffeine than any doctor would recommend - the C750 is ready for takeoff on July 10â, they said at the start of their announcement post on Discord. âWe know it has been a long road, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and support from this community. Weâre excited to finally get it into your handsâ. The Cessna 750 Citation X is a mid-size business jet produced by Cessna, announced in October 1990 and first flown in 1993, with its certification following 3 years later. It used an entirely new design compared to the previous Citations, with commonality only being maintained around some cockpit controls, the windshield, and the tail light bulb. It incorporated many innovative design features for the time, such as the large diameter of the engine intakes, reducing the noise, and improving fuel efficiency. The highly swept wing with a supercritical airfoil increased its top speed, making it faster than all the previous generations.Â  â The design process also involved making it as aerodynamically efficient as possible, trying to minimize drag and, thus, improve its overall efficiency. The innovative wing design was part of that thought process during the development. â Itâs powered by two Rolls-Royce AE 3007Cs with either 6442 or 6764 lbs of thrust, allowing it to cruise at 972 km/h, covering up to 3,460 nautical miles of range, at up to 51,000ft.Â  â FlightFXâs rendition features an accurate simulation of the Primus 2000 flight suite, full VNAV, a custom FADEC with an optional VNAV-coupled auto-throttle, two variants: winglet or no-winglet with their respective performance impact, a real-time EPB system for dynamic engine performance modeling, a deeply modeled pressurization, environmental, hydraulic, electrical, fuel, and ICE systems, full RTU and autopilot capability, realistic IRS, CAS, engine sync, and more. Their custom Electronic Flight Bag features Navigraph and OpenStreetMap integration, a SimBrief-linked load manager, active noise reduction, a ground services manager, and an options customizer (auto-throttle, LCD/CRT toggle, etc.). â The airplane also features wing flex, enhanced lighting inside and out, realistic clutter and cabin details, and dynamic registration on the placard and covers. â The audio was recorded on-site in California, with real APU, engine, mechanical, chime, and cabin interaction sounds. â The add-on is releasing on July 10, exclusively at the Marketplace for $29.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has released version 1.1.0 of its A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, bringing a raft of improvements and additions, including the long-awaited A350 ULR variant. The A350 ULR, or Ultra Long Range, features an increased maximum takeoff weight and fuel capacity, with a range of up to 9,700 nautical miles. Designed for non-stop, ultra-long-haul flights, it supports operations lasting over 19 hours, with Singapore Airlines operating the type exclusively, in a two-class, premium-heavy configuration. iniBuilds has adapted this layout for their ULR variant in MSFS 2024, bringing a reworked cabin and compatibility with FS24âs career mode, including interactive boarding procedures. Further additions include the integration of functional emergency evacuation slides and the PDOS (Power Door Opening System) for opening the engine cowlings. Performance has seen additional improvements, with reduced CPU load and a streamlined WASM structure. Furthermore, iniBuilds has overhauled the ECAM, refined the fly-by-wire system, and introduced several new FMS features, including Conditional Descent Advisory and Estimated Time to Target. The update also introduces support for iniBuilds' new modular cabin packs, a separately sold line of swappable, airline-specific interiors, providing realistic cabin layouts from carriers like Air France, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa. Artwork updates include refined nose cone shading, reworked cockpit sidesticks, adjusted camera positions, and cockpit storm lighting. iniBuilds has also integrated event-driven scenarios and confirmed upcoming support for a 3D HUD with dynamic projection and crosswind adaptation. Despite popular demand, 8x time compression remains unsupported, due to instability in the autopilot logic at high speeds. iniBuilds also affirmed their confidence in the aircraftâs flight model, citing validation through full-motion simulators, while noting user experience may vary depending on hardware. The developer recommends users apply a 1:1 axis curve for the most accurate control feel.Â  â iniBuilds closed their post with a single teaser image of what appears to be an Airbus A340-300, possibly hinting at their next big project. As the A350 Airliner enters a more mature development phase, iniBuilds plans to space out future updates, while continuing work on feature enhancements and long-term refinements. â You can find the

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar has during during #FSExpoFriday 2025 given an update on the future of X-Plane 12, with performance improvements, art upgrades, and major simulation system enhancements all in active development. The team confirmed that version 12.2.1 will enter public beta next Friday, while the highly anticipated 12.3.0 release will begin private beta testing the same day. â The presentation began with a recap of version 12.2, which is now publicly available. Key fixes and visual improvements include updated ground textures, revised lighting and atmospheric rendering, new aircraft braking effects, and a resolution to the long-standing dark cockpit issue, significantly improving visibility across default aircraft. Laminar also previewed upcoming additions to the X-Plane Gateway, with new community-driven assets currently in development. These include various fire trucks, police cars, construction vehicles, enhanced ramp lighting, and improved ground markings. Much of this work is being led by newly joined scenery artist Justin, also known as Mr. X, and the team highlighted the ability to customise ramps with new compass roses, labels, and colours. The upcoming 12.3.0 version will introduce a foundational shift in how X-Plane uses CPU resources. Laminar has confirmed that multi-core rendering is now in development, with a new job system already built to handle AI traffic, texture paging, and network synchronisation. Internal testing has demonstrated performance gains of up to 30% at graphically intensive airports, such as Frankfurt. Additional optimisation targets GPU and VRAM usage. Laminar is currently refining cloud rendering and night lighting processes, which should result in greater efficiency and reduced GPU workload, particularly beneficial for users running in 4K. Laminar is adopting new virtual memory techniques, to speed up texture loading and safely offload unused graphical assets. The default Airbus A330 is set for a major update, with reworked metallic surfaces, improved textures, detailed weathering and glare shield fixes.  Furthermore, brake fire simulations, refined lighting and cabin ambience, dynamic passenger lighting, and altitude-aware illumination modes were also shown off. A major technical addition is a fully GPU-bound weather radar, integrated by default on the default Boeing 737-800, A330-300, MD-82, Cirrus Visionjet, Baron B58 and Citation X.  The default weather radar includes manual tilt, ground clutter filtering, sector scanning, and predictive wind shear alerts. An API has been made available for third-party developers to integrate the feature into their products. â The G1000 avionics suite has also been upgraded, now featuring synthetic vision, rendered entirely on the GPU. This allows terrain, obstacle, and traffic overlays, including support for online networks like VATSIM and IVAO, without adding CPU overhead or impacting performance. Beyond the simulator core, Laminar reaffirmed progress on its new X-Plane Store. The backend now supports account-based logins and is integrating modern payment systems. â More details are expected as development on the 12.3.0 update continues. â For all the latest updates, be sure to follow Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
