    <summary>Sim: FS24. Carenado has released its Beechcraft Baron B55 for MSFS 2024, available exclusively through the in-sim Marketplace. The light twin-engine aircraft arrives as the latest addition to the developerâs growing MSFS 2024 catalogue. The Baron B55 is a light twin, first introduced in 1961, as part of Beechcraftâs Baron family, which evolved from the earlier Travel Air. Production of the 55 series continued until 1983, with 3,651 units built. Powered by two Continental IO-470-L engines, producing 260 horsepower each, the aircraft is capable of cruising at around 190 knots, with a range of more than 900 nautical miles. Its six-seat layout and twin-engine configuration made it a popular choice for both private and training operations. Carenadoâs rendition of the type for MSFS 2024 includes avionics options such as Aspen Avionicsâ EFD1000, or traditional steam gauges, Garmin GNS530 and GNS430 units, with GTN750/650 compatibility, and the Bendix King KFC 225 autopilot. The package also features eight liveries, plus a paint kit, and an EFB with 2024 interfacing, for switching between avionics configurations.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has shared an update of its highly anticipated HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update was posted on its community forum earlier this week. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, this is the third and final planned preview before release. The previews highlight the Delta TechOps area and the airportâs control tower, amongst others. Delta TechOps, also known as Delta TOC, is the largest airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in North America, and has been recreated in the scenery, with 1:1 accuracy. Veneziani stated that âevery pipe, air-conditioning unit, and rooftop elementâ was individually modelled, based on real-world references. While the developer showcased the maintenance complex, he noted that the airside portion of the airport is not yet ready for display, as the ground polygon is still in progress. Remaining work includes cargo buildings on both the north and south sides, taxiway signage, approach lighting, and tunnel detailing, as well as general finishing touches. According to Veneziani, the goal is to release the scenery before Christmas. He noted that development has been underway for nearly two years, with a continued emphasis on quality over timelines. HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport is the worldâs busiest by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, serving as Delta Air Linesâ primary hub. We'll keep you updated on its release. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <title>Microsoft Releases Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/m24su3"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68a60ad358e0cbc5c1aeb202_MSFS2024_VisID_9600x5400.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the highly anticipated Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024, marking one of the biggest updates to the simulator since launch. It brings performance fixes, weather and world upgrades, aircraft, traffic, and ATC changes, airport improvements, SDK updates, and broad adjustments to core systems, and career mode. Labelled version 1.5.27.0, SU3 brings wide-ranging changes, including the highly requested ability to locally download content from the MSFS Library. This allows more control over content management, with simulator files being able to be stored locally on a userâs system, rather than relying solely on cloud-based streaming and internet downloads. Fixes to weather include an issue where the correct METAR data was not always honoured at airports; furthermore, lightning in storms is now far less excessive, thunderstorm prediction is better, and cloud transitions on the world map are smoother. Distant cloud lighting has been improved, photogrammetry tile popping is reduced, and map camera zooming has been corrected. Streaming reliability should be better, including fixes for freezes caused by mislabelled sound folders. AI and live traffic now flow more smoothly, with fewer overshoots, ârear-end incidentsâ, and stuck vehicles. Taxi speeds have been tuned, parked aircraft distribution rebalanced, and model-matching now prefers AI-optimised assets. Contrails rendering has been improved, gear animations have been corrected, livery depiction improved, and generic placeholder aircraft have been phased out. Aircraft across the default fleet have received updates, with refinements to Garmin avionics and autopilot systems. The Boeing 787, 747, and Airbus A320neo have seen flight dynamics and stability tweaks, while the Cessna 172 and Daher TBM 930 have received various bug fixes and performance improvements. Significant performance and stability upgrades have also been introduced. Sim Update 3 includes better memory management, improved CPU and GPU balancing, and reduced stuttering, during heavy scenery loading. Smoother framerates should be noticable in high-density areas, such as large international airports, and photogrammetry-heavy cities.Â  Some of the addressed issues include Xbox boot crashes when many packages are installed, several rare parser and stallâwarning crashes, VR in/out switching, airportârendering freezes, and texture handling that could corrupt WASM gauges, on Series S, or lowâtexture settings on PC. Menu caching in Controls now reduces unnecessary file I/O, and avatar thumbnails are generated faster. DLSS MultiâFrame Generation options have been corrected, and multiple content management edge cases have been cleaned up, in order to prevent profile or content conflicts. Sim Update 3 is available now on all platforms, as a free download for all MSFS 2024 users. Full patch notes can be found on the official Microsoft Flight Simulator website, and the MSFS forums.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has just released the Eurocopter EC 135 for free, alongside Sim Update 3, which was also released earlier today.Â  The Eurocopter EC135 is an advanced light twin-engine utility helicopter that can seat up to eight passengers, produced by Airbus Helicopters, previously named Eurocopter. This is Microsoftâs 21st âLocal Legendâ, and is the last of the four free aircraft promised by Microsoft to make up for MSFS 2024âs launch problems.Â  The Eurocopter has a rich history, originating from a collaboration between Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm (MBB) and Aerospatiale in the 1970s. The EC 135 introduced innovative technologies such as full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) for helicopters and a hingeless main rotor. The company that developed the EC 135 has undergone significant changes over the years. Originally known as MBB, it was acquired by Daimler-Benz and subsequently merged into DASA. In 1992, DASA joined forces with Aerospatiale to become Eurocopter, which was later rebranded as Airbus Helicopters in 2014. Because of the 2014 rebranding, what was previously the Eurocopter EC 135 is today branded as the Airbus Helicopters H135. The Eurocopter EC 135 is now available for free in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SimWorks Studios has released the GA-8 Airvan for MSFS 2020, bringing one of Australiaâs most versatile general aviation aircraft into the sim, with an MSFS 2024 release to follow. The Airvan has been developed with a strong focus on realism. You can choose between cargo and passenger layouts, with or without the cargo pod. The aircraft features a highly detailed 3D model, sounds recorded from a real GA-8, and a custom flight model, verified by pilots of the type. Dynamic wear and tear is included, where dirt and mud can accumulate over flight hours. These visual details persist between flights, and even rain can wash the aircraft clean again. A tablet EFB is included, giving access to loading options, checklists, avionics hot-swapping between GTN750Xi, GTN750, and GNS530/430, as well as access to various aircraft settings. Manuals and configuration tools are built directly into the tablet, keeping everything accessible from the cockpit. This release also marks the debut of SystemsPulse, SimWorks Studiosâ new technology, designed to simulate deeper aircraft behaviour. Available in the SystemsPulse Edition of the Airvan, sold separately, the expansion introduces over 70 failure scenarios that may occur randomly, progressively with use, or at the pilotâs command. Covering areas such as engine performance, electrical systems, and operational wear, SystemsPulse gives additional incentive to manage the aircraft properly, as if you were its real-world operator. Both editions come with an official paint kit and a PDF manual. Six liveries are provided across pod and non-pod variants, including base white, Stichting Hoogvliegers, Nissos Kos, VortX, Yellow, and Safari Wings. Customers who purchase the MSFS 2020 version of the GA-8 Airvan now will also receive the MSFS 2024 edition, at no extra cost, upon release. The GA-8 Airvan is available now on the MSFS Marketplace for $29.99, with the optional SystemsPulse expansion sold separately for $17.49. A future release is planned for the SimWorks Studios store.

    <title>Li Scenery Studio Releases Zhoushan Putuoshan International Airport for MSFS 2020</title>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/68a7cfa63ca4dd36a4fe1782_zhou1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Li Scenery Studio recently released their rendition of Zhoushan Putuoshan International Airport (ZSZS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves Zhoushan in Zhujiajian Island, China, and has a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers. The construction work started in early 1994, and the challenges started from the get-go due to the terrain: a low-lying area of rice paddies, which demanded the placement of millions of cubic meters of landfill to raise the land a little bit above sea level. It wasnât until 1997 that the airport was ready for inauguration. Upgrades were carried out gradually in the decades that followed its inauguration, ensuring that it could accommodate the ever-rising passenger figures. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 2019 to consolidate it as the regional hub for aviation. Chengdu Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Express Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China United Airlines, Donghai Airlines, Fuzhou Airlines, Greater Bay Airlines, GX Airlines, Okay Airways, Qingdao Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, West Air, and XiamenAir serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, a basic terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.53, requiring at least 69.34 MB of free hard disk space to install.
