    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has recently released the highly anticipated Sim Update 3 for MSFS 2024, marking one of the biggest updates to the simulator since launch. It brings performance fixes, weather and world upgrades, aircraft, traffic, and ATC changes, airport improvements, SDK updates, and broad adjustments to core systems, and career mode. Labelled version 1.5.27.0, SU3 brings wide-ranging changes, including the highly requested ability to locally download content from the MSFS Library. This allows more control over content management, with simulator files being able to be stored locally on a userâs system, rather than relying solely on cloud-based streaming and internet downloads. Fixes to weather include an issue where the correct METAR data was not always honoured at airports; furthermore, lightning in storms is now far less excessive, thunderstorm prediction is better, and cloud transitions on the world map are smoother. Distant cloud lighting has been improved, photogrammetry tile popping is reduced, and map camera zooming has been corrected. Streaming reliability should be better, including fixes for freezes caused by mislabelled sound folders. AI and live traffic now flow more smoothly, with fewer overshoots, ârear-end incidentsâ, and stuck vehicles. Taxi speeds have been tuned, parked aircraft distribution rebalanced, and model-matching now prefers AI-optimised assets. Contrails rendering has been improved, gear animations have been corrected, livery depiction improved, and generic placeholder aircraft have been phased out. Aircraft across the default fleet have received updates, with refinements to Garmin avionics and autopilot systems. The Boeing 787, 747, and Airbus A320neo have seen flight dynamics and stability tweaks, while the Cessna 172 and Daher TBM 930 have received various bug fixes and performance improvements. Significant performance and stability upgrades have also been introduced. Sim Update 3 includes better memory management, improved CPU and GPU balancing, and reduced stuttering, during heavy scenery loading. Smoother framerates should be noticable in high-density areas, such as large international airports, and photogrammetry-heavy cities.Â  Some of the addressed issues include Xbox boot crashes when many packages are installed, several rare parser and stallâwarning crashes, VR in/out switching, airportârendering freezes, and texture handling that could corrupt WASM gauges, on Series S, or lowâtexture settings on PC. Menu caching in Controls now reduces unnecessary file I/O, and avatar thumbnails are generated faster. DLSS MultiâFrame Generation options have been corrected, and multiple content management edge cases have been cleaned up, in order to prevent profile or content conflicts. Sim Update 3 is available now on all platforms, as a free download for all MSFS 2024 users. Full patch notes can be found on the official Microsoft Flight Simulator website, and the MSFS forums.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has just released the Eurocopter EC 135 for free, alongside Sim Update 3, which was also released earlier today.Â  The Eurocopter EC135 is an advanced light twin-engine utility helicopter that can seat up to eight passengers, produced by Airbus Helicopters, previously named Eurocopter. This is Microsoftâs 21st âLocal Legendâ, and is the last of the four free aircraft promised by Microsoft to make up for MSFS 2024âs launch problems.Â  The Eurocopter has a rich history, originating from a collaboration between Messerschmitt-BÃ¶lkow-Blohm (MBB) and Aerospatiale in the 1970s. The EC 135 introduced innovative technologies such as full-authority digital engine controls (FADEC) for helicopters and a hingeless main rotor. The company that developed the EC 135 has undergone significant changes over the years. Originally known as MBB, it was acquired by Daimler-Benz and subsequently merged into DASA. In 1992, DASA joined forces with Aerospatiale to become Eurocopter, which was later rebranded as Airbus Helicopters in 2014. Because of the 2014 rebranding, what was previously the Eurocopter EC 135 is today branded as the Airbus Helicopters H135. The Eurocopter EC 135 is now available for free in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Togstad Simulation Products has just launched its version of RÃ¸rvik Airport (ENRM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Situated in TrÃ¸ndelag county, approximately 3 nautical miles from the town of RÃ¸rvik, this small public airport facilitates flights to and from Trondheim and Namsos, operated by the airline WiderÃ¸e. After opening in 1986, the airport's initial service was provided by the airline Norving, which operated the Dornier 228. However, Norving announced the termination of its services in 1988, leaving the airport without any scheduled flights. That same year, WiderÃ¸e began operating flights to and from the airport. Today, WiderÃ¸e remains the only airline with scheduled services available. It operates its Dash 8-100 and Dash 8-200 aircraft on routes to both Trondheim and Namsos, bringing nearly 40,000 passengers to the airport each year. The newly released RÃ¸rvik Airport scenery includes custom buildings, 3D models, detailed interiors, custom runway lights, taxiway lights, and much more. The newly released RÃ¸rvik Airport from Togstad Simulation Products is now available through Orbx for approximately $12.83. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. SimWorks Studios has released the GA-8 Airvan for MSFS 2020, bringing one of Australiaâs most versatile general aviation aircraft into the sim, with an MSFS 2024 release to follow. The Airvan has been developed with a strong focus on realism. You can choose between cargo and passenger layouts, with or without the cargo pod. The aircraft features a highly detailed 3D model, sounds recorded from a real GA-8, and a custom flight model, verified by pilots of the type. Dynamic wear and tear is included, where dirt and mud can accumulate over flight hours. These visual details persist between flights, and even rain can wash the aircraft clean again. A tablet EFB is included, giving access to loading options, checklists, avionics hot-swapping between GTN750Xi, GTN750, and GNS530/430, as well as access to various aircraft settings. Manuals and configuration tools are built directly into the tablet, keeping everything accessible from the cockpit. This release also marks the debut of SystemsPulse, SimWorks Studiosâ new technology, designed to simulate deeper aircraft behaviour. Available in the SystemsPulse Edition of the Airvan, sold separately, the expansion introduces over 70 failure scenarios that may occur randomly, progressively with use, or at the pilotâs command. Covering areas such as engine performance, electrical systems, and operational wear, SystemsPulse gives additional incentive to manage the aircraft properly, as if you were its real-world operator. Both editions come with an official paint kit and a PDF manual. Six liveries are provided across pod and non-pod variants, including base white, Stichting Hoogvliegers, Nissos Kos, VortX, Yellow, and Safari Wings. Customers who purchase the MSFS 2020 version of the GA-8 Airvan now will also receive the MSFS 2024 edition, at no extra cost, upon release. The GA-8 Airvan is available now on the MSFS Marketplace for $29.99, with the optional SystemsPulse expansion sold separately for $17.49. A future release is planned for the SimWorks Studios store.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Li Scenery Studio recently released their rendition of Zhoushan Putuoshan International Airport (ZSZS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The airport serves Zhoushan in Zhujiajian Island, China, and has a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers. The construction work started in early 1994, and the challenges started from the get-go due to the terrain: a low-lying area of rice paddies, which demanded the placement of millions of cubic meters of landfill to raise the land a little bit above sea level. It wasnât until 1997 that the airport was ready for inauguration. Upgrades were carried out gradually in the decades that followed its inauguration, ensuring that it could accommodate the ever-rising passenger figures. A new passenger terminal was inaugurated in 2019 to consolidate it as the regional hub for aviation. Chengdu Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Express Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China United Airlines, Donghai Airlines, Fuzhou Airlines, Greater Bay Airlines, GX Airlines, Okay Airways, Qingdao Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Shanghai Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines, West Air, and XiamenAir serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, a basic terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.53, requiring at least 69.34 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>SimNord Releases Copenhagen Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimNord has recently released their rendition of Copenhagen Airport (EKCH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, the second largest airport in the Nordic countries, serving Denmark and Southern Sweden with over 30 million passengers yearly. It was inaugurated in 1925, making it one of the first civil airports in the world and one of the oldest still in operation. The structure consisted of a large wooden terminal, a few hangars, a hydroplane landing stage, and grass meadows used as runways. A horde of sheep feasted on the grass meadows daily, constantly keeping them short. In the 1930s, passenger numbers grew quite significantly, reaching almost 100,000, prompting the construction of a new terminal, which was built between 1936 and 1939. It was designed by Vilhelm Lauritzen and widely considered one of the finest examples of Nordic functionalism, focusing on passenger comfort and overall efficiency. During World War 2, the airport was mostly closed for civil operations, aside from a few periodic flights to Sweden and Germany. During that time, they also got the first hard-surface runway, 1400 meters long and 65 meters wide. By the end of the war, Copenhagen was the most modern airport in Europe, primarily because it remained undamaged throughout the conflict, which many other airports in Europe could not say the same about. By 1948, it was already the third-largest airport in Europe, with 300,000 passengers yearly. This led to continuous expansion work to ensure the utmost comfort for everybody.Â  In 1956, Copenhagen hit the million passenger mark for the first time, largely due to its increased popularity among Hollywood stars and producers, giving it newfound glamour. In the early 1960s, a new terminal was built, able to handle 28 jets at the same time. This quickly became relatively suboptimal, kicking off another expansion program in the final part of the decade. Domestic traffic was relocated to a new terminal, and the international terminal got a new pier and arrivals hall. Furthermore, the airport also got a new control tower and a new 3,600-meter-long runway. By the 1970s, the airport was already handling 8 million passengers, which was not followed by any expansion work, as there were plans to build a new airport elsewhere, which was eventually ruled out due to the very high costs and work involved. Instead, they figured it would be cheaper to expand the current one to handle 20 to 22 million passengers yearly by 2000.Â  The expansion work kicked off in 1982. The aim was to build not Europeâs largest airport but one of the most efficient in terms of reachability. Furthermore, they wanted to create an âoasisâ where passengers could relax before their trips.Â  â In the late 1990s, the airport expanded again, creating a pier connecting the domestic and international terminals, a new arrivals hall, new baggage handling facilities, an underground railway station, and a new terminal able to handle 17 million passengers per year alone. â In 2006, Copenhagen finally surpassed their target of 20 million passengers yearly, hitting 20,900,000 passengers. â Shortly after, the administration announced their plans to build a new low-cost terminal, which was completed in 2010 and opened by easyJet.Â  Itâs a hub for Danish Air Transport and Scandinavian Airlines, a focus city for Air Greenland and Finnair, and an operating base for Jettime, Norwegian Air Shuttle, and Sunclass Airlines. More than 50 airlines worldwide serve it, including Aegean, Air Canada, Air China, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Emirates, Finnair, Qatar Airways, and Turkish Airlines. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom ground poly, detailed buildings, custom aerial imagery, and more. â Itâs available on their website for roughly $25.58.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts has shared the first in-depth look at its upcoming ERJ Family 2.0 update, showcasing a fully reworked cockpit, with a new avionics suite, and major visual upgrades. The previews highlight extensive modelling work across the flight deck, with detailed views of the yoke, overhead panel, autopilot mode control panel, and the electronic flight bag, amongst others. We also see the redesigned primary and multi-function displays, a brand-new FMS, and new pop-up functionality for improved usability. According to the developer, all displays have been rebuilt, with much higher resolution, while a new EFB has been designed, specifically for the ERJs. Both FMS units can be popped out into 2D panels or dragged onto external monitors. Despite the increase in fidelity, X-Crafts says optimisation techniques developed during the Lineage 1000 project help to keep performance impact low. The Embraer ERJ family, short for Embraer Regional Jet, includes the ERJ 135, ERJ 140, and ERJ 145, as well as derivatives such as the Legacy 600 business jet and the R-99 military series. First entering service in the mid-1990s, the ERJ went on to sell more than 1,200 aircraft worldwide before being succeeded by Embraerâs newer E-Jets.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Scenery developer Devinci has recently released a new rendition of Senegalâs Blaise Diagne International Airport (GOBD) for MSFS 2024. The scenery has been rebuilt from the ground up for MSFS 2024 with a wide range of upgrades, including full PBR 4K textures, a detailed terminal interior, custom ground markings, and accurate night lighting. The developer has also included the Train Express Regional (TER) station, fire station, VIP facilities, and control tower, along with custom jetways and handcrafted aprons. Located roughly 27 miles east of Senegalâs capital, Dakar, in the ThiÃ¨s Region, Blaise Diagne opened in December 2017 to replace the overcrowded LÃ©opold SÃ©dar Senghor International Airport. Named after politician Blaise Diagne, it now serves as the countryâs primary aviation hub, handling over two million passengers annually. Furthermore, Devinci states that performance has been a key focus, with custom LODs, to ensure smoothness across a variety of systems. Owners of the previous MSFS 2020 version are eligible for a discounted upgrade to this 2024 release. You can view the feature list below: â âï¸ Key Features â Blaise Diagne International Airport for MSFS 2024 is available via SimMarket for around $21.80, including sales tax.

    <title>UK2000 Scenery Releases Birmingham Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Birmingham Airport (EGBB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the West Midlands in the United Kingdom and has a yearly average of 12.8 million passengers, making it the seventh busiest in the Country. The idea for an airport in Birmingham was first conceived in 1928, and a committee was created shortly after to research possible locations to start building. After much deliberation, Elmdon was deemed the best of the bunch, but the project soon went back to the drawing board due to the Great Depression. It wasnât until 1933 that works resumed, with a new committee formed to oversee its construction. Before taking any steps, though, the newly formed committee went on a research trip to multiple successful airports in Europe, such as Schiphol (Amsterdam), Berlin (Tempelhof), Paris (Orly), Brussels, and London.Â  â By January 1935, they had finally approached a companyâNorman and Dawbarnâto advise on the construction and help design the airport as lead architects. Groundwork started in 1936, after the government allowed the airportâs development. A year later, in 1937, Norman and Dawbarn were authorized to begin drawing the airportâs project, the undertaking of which took 6 months to reach completion. It was not until October 1937 that the construction of the airportâs buildings would start, costing around 360,000 pounds. â Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain opened the airport in July 1939 as Elmdon Airport. The terminal featured a modern (for late 30s standards) art deco design with an integrated control tower and was the airportâs main terminal until 1984.Â  The airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry to be used by both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy as RAF Elmdon during World War 2. The military âoccupationâ replaced the original grass runways with two hard runways, 753 meters in length and 1,271 meters in length, respectively.Â  â It was used as a testbed for Avro Lancasters and Stirling bombers manufactured in northeast Worcestershire. These bombers were transported via land to Elmdon because their local airport didnât have a long enough runway. On July 8, 1946, the airport, which was celebrating its 7th anniversary, was reopened for civilian use, albeit still government-controlled. Scheduled services started in 1949 with British European Airways, flying passengers to Paris. Over the years, the airline eventually expanded its network to ZÃ¼rich, DÃ¼sseldorf, Palma, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. In the early 1960s, they built a new terminal to handle international traffic and extended the main runway to 2.2 km, allowing the airport to handle larger turboprop aircraft and jetliners. â By the beginning of the 1970s, Birmingham Airport was already reaching a million passengers per year, significantly congesting their subpar terminal infrastructure. In the 1980s, BHX became home to the worldâs first commercial maglev system, a train levitated by magnets. This system ran for nearly 10 years but eventually faced discontinuation due to unreliability. It was replaced by a cable-hauled system in 2003. â In late 2007, the airportâs administration devised a development plan for Birmingham called âTowards 2030: Planning a Sustainable Future for Air Transport in the Midlands.â The plan included changes to the terminals, alterations to the airfield layout, and infrastructure improvements. Unexpectedly, environmentalists and locals complained, as they didnât want the construction of a second parallel runway.Â  The original planânow canceledâcould have created up to 250,000 jobs in the area, made the airport handle up to 70 million passengers annually, and led to around 500,000 aircraft movements in total. â In 2008, the shorter runway (06/24) was decommissioned due to its length and noise impact. Instead, it became a taxiway, allowing the expansion of the apron.Â  Construction work on the new 3-storey International Pier kicked off in June of that same year, taking a bit more than a year to complete. Now, Birmingham Airport was fully compatible with the Airbus A380, which visited the airport during its 70th birthday. It was the first commercial service of the A380 in the United Kingdom that was not bound to London Heathrow. â In 2010, it was announced that they would merge Terminal 1 and 2 into a single building and change the name from Birmingham International Airport to Birmingham Airport. They figured this could help create a new corporate identity that would better reflect their current position in the market and attract more people to fly from it. Research showed that while 8 million people lived within an hour of the airport, only 40% of them used it.Â  â A new control tower was built in 2011, ultimately replacing the original one built in 1939. â The plans for extending the main runway, originally submitted in 2008, were approved a year later, but the work was only completed in 2014, two years after their original target, which was the 2012 London Olympics.Â  In late 2016, 100 million pounds were invested in building a new baggage handling system and two new car parks. â Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Jet2, Ryanair, and TUI Airways, and served by Aer Lingus, Air France, Air India, Aurigny, Brussels Airlines, Corendon Airlines, Emirates, Eurowings, KLM, Loganair, Lufthansa, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Scandinavian Airlines, SunExpress, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, Vueling, and WizzAir. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with full detail buildings, custom ground markings, custom night lighting, PBR textures, animated jetways, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $12.81, requiring at least 87.86 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Backwood Studios has recently released Shady Cove Airport (OG31) for MSFS 2024, bringing a detailed rendition of the small Oregon airpark and its surrounding community. The scenery recreates Shady Coveâs dirt runway, fly-in homes, custom hangars, and private fuelling facilities, alongside handcrafted static objects, custom vegetation, and more than 10 miles of custom roads that connect Shady Cove to the nearby Sutton Airstrip, also developed by Backwood. The 2024 version also adds new community homes, optimised ground textures, and bespoke lighting for both daytime and night operations. Shady Cove Airpark itself has deep roots in Oregon's aviation history. Originally opened in 1949 by pilots Edward T. Tepper and John P. Jones, the airstrip grew from a grassroots flying field into a small aviation community, perched on a plateau above the Rogue River. It remains active today, serving local pilots, Mercy Flights medical operations, and even Department of Forestry crews during fire season. The airpark is also a gateway to the Pacific Northwestâs natural attractions, including Crater Lake, Diamond Lake, and the Rogue River, offering both a scenic flying destination and a community hub. Backwood modelled not just the runway and hangars, but much of the town itself, creating a sense of life and place. Backwood Studiosâ Shady Cove Airport is available now on OrbxDirect for $4.52, excluding sales tax. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released Hogsback Ranch for MSFS 2024, introducing a fully revamped version of their private luxury airstrip for the new 2024 simulator. Located in Tehama County, California, the ranch combines rugged backcountry flying with high-end residential, giving a rather unique home base for flying in the northern Californian hills.Â  The package features two short runways, a 984-foot gravel strip and a 1,043-foot dirt strip, alongside a private hangar, solar-powered runway lighting, and an asphalt helipad. Approach paths are intentionally challenging, with cliffs, gates, and nearby power lines requiring some carefulness when committing to landing. Dynamic wildlife, hand-modelled vegetation, and Parallel 42âs TrailBlazer terrain technology are also used. Beyond the airstrip, the scenery recreates the entire ranch property. Highlights include stables, campsites, a swimming pool with custom lighting, and explorable interiors in Walkaround Mode. There are also plenty of micro scenes, for example, a âparty modeâ inside the main house, and smaller environmental details around the property. Hogsback Ranch also supports MSFS 2024âs new fauna and visitor systems. Owners of Hogsback Ranch for MSFS 2020 can upgrade to the 2024 edition for $2, using code HOGSBACK24, valid through Feb. 5, 2026. New customers can purchase the product for $14.00 USD, including taxes. Hogsback Ranch is available now via the Parallel 42 store for PC, with releases on Contrail, Orbx, and the in-sim Marketplace (PC and Xbox) to follow. â</summary>
