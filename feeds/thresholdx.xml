    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly X Simulations has recently released their rendition of Kefalonia International Airport (LGKF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the island of Kefalonia, Greece, with a yearly average of 817,216 passengers. It was opened in 1971 to serve the municipality of Leivatho, which no longer exists. A decade later, a new runway and the former main passenger terminal were built. The airport was privatized in December 2015 as part of a government plan to privatize some of their airports, in a batch with 13 other regional airports. A joint venture between Fraport AG/ Copelouzos Group won the concession to operate the entire batch for 40 years as of April 2017. The new operators heavily upgraded the airport, constructing a new passenger terminal building and modernizing the infrastructure with new check-in desks, security lanes, and a larger airside space with more shops. Aegean Airlines (year-long), Air Serbia, Animawings, Austrian Airlines, Avanti Air, British Airways, Condor, Discover Airlines, easyJet, ITA Airways, Jet2.com, Marathon Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Peopleâs, Ryanair, Sky Express, Smartwings, Transavia, TUI Airways, TUI fly Netherlands, Tus Airways, Volotea, and Wizz Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom airport buildings, custom ground textures, high-resolution PBR textures, and more. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $12.79, requiring at least 852 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Teases Upcoming London Luton Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-03-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inilut"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66048a447bad63a31734918e_luton2.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently teased the development progress on their rendition of London Luton Airport (EGGW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Greater London, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Northamptonshire, Hertfordshire, and Cambridgeshire with a yearly average of 13.3 million passengers, making it the fifth busiest airport in the United Kingdom. Opened in 1938, Luton was of great importance to the Royal Air Force during World War 2, with commercial activities only resuming seven years after the conflict.  Luton was pivotal to developing the package holiday business in the UK, amounting to a fifth of all holiday flights in the United Kingdom by 1969, leading to a major expansion plan in the subsequent decade to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic figures.  Fate might have been a bit cruel to Luton, as the figures dipped massively in the 1980s, leading to the addition of âLondonâ to its name to emphasize its proximity to the capital. â While the extra traffic did, in fact, come during the 1990s, it was in no way due to the renaming strategy, but by embracing charter operators and low-cost carriers such as Debonair and easyJet, which transformed it into the fastest growing major airport in the country.  â The rapid growth was rewarded with an 80 million pound investment program, which improved its infrastructure and facilities. It was followed by the construction of a 40 million pound terminal in 1999, opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip, housing 60 check-in desks and a range of commercial outlets. Six years later, the departure and arrival lounges were redeveloped at the cost of 38 million pounds. â Further development was conducted in 2018 at the cost of 160 million pounds, including new shops, a new boarding pier, and more boarding gates, increasing the passenger handling capabilities to 18 million a year.  â Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Wizz Air UK, which, aside from Dan Air, El Al, FlyOne, and SunExpress, are the only ones that serve the airport, making it a full LCC-centric hub.  â Thereâs no information on the release date or pricing yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <title>JustFlight Announces BAe 146 V2 Update</title>
    <updated>2024-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/jfbae2"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. JustFlight has announced a new update for BAe 146 Professional for MSFS on social media. This update will be free of charge for all customers on both PC and Xbox. The update will be available on the 1st of April. This update will bring users the highly-requested UNS-1. The FMS will feature a unique interface of the real unit along with the holding pattern, direct to, and command heading functions, TOD calculations based on target VS, navigation monitoring, real-time performance information, support for SID and STAR, as well as the ability to import and export flight plans.  An in-depth manual for UNS-1 that contains all its features will be provided with the update.  The WT ProLine 21 that was included in v1 will still be available in the new update, and the two types of the FMS can be changed in the EFB. A brand new, high-detailed passenger cabin will also be present in v2. Each version of BAe146 will receive a new cabin design, followed by fully interactive FWD and AFT galleys (yes, the coffee maker is functional!), cabin lighting controls, cabin calls, and ground service electrical supplier simulation. Another interesting feature is a music player - it comes with 7 music tracks that can be controlled by the user. Players will be able to import their custom music through the cabin speakers. A new boarding simulation will be added in the update. The EFB will now feature several different boarding/deboarding speeds, ranging from instant to realistic. For instance, boarding a fully loaded BAe 146-300 could take up to 20 minutes! During boarding, you can hear new passenger boarding sounds. GSX profiles for each variant will be included. Another highly-requested feature is a paper clipboard instead of the modern EFB. Unfortunately, it will take some time to convert all the functions of EFB to the clipboard, but JF has announced that they have started working on that. This update will feature something rustic though, as pilots will be able to use a paper checklist on the yoke, which can have up to 15 pages, and the paper charts that are stored in the charts holder will hover over the top pedestal after being clicked on. Up to 20 charts can be stored, and custom checklists and charts can be imported by placing PNG images in the necessary folder. The new update will also feature three new default liveries for the -200 and -300 variants. The -200 variant will receive a Discovery Air livery (US Honolulu-based airline), while the -300 will receive United Express Battleship Gray and buzz liveries (not to be confused with Buzz - Ryanair subsidiary) A plethora of new features are in the v2 update, some of them being: an updated flight model for better ground handling, improved AP altitude capture, improved cabin door and airstair animation, as well as new wiper animations. The full changelog can be found here. Updated BAe 146 Operation Manual, EFB manual, and UNS-1 manual are provided with the newest update. How do you like the newest update? Is there anything new you would like to see in the future on BAe 146 Professional? Let us know in the comments! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has just announced a new map for DCS: Afghanistan. This map will include the whole territory of Afghanistan, along with small portions of neighbouring countries.  The Afghanistan map is available for pre-purchase with a 30% discount at $48.99 USD. The early access price will include a $20 discount or $55.99 USD, until the final release. ED has also made an option for players to purchase regions separately: Southwest, East, and North. Each region will be offered as a separate release at approximately 3 month intervals. The first region available for separate purchase is Southwest, and it is priced at $23.99 USD for the pre-purchase price, or $29.99 USD for the full release price. North and East regions will be available for purchase later this year.

    <title>PMDG Publishes Jokeless April Fools Day Development Update</title>
    <updated>2024-04-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777041"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/660b6a529653d007ea9eda3d_777new.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has published a new development update with information on a recent 737 update, two new 77W teasers, and more.Â  Allegedly too busy with their upcoming products to be "funny," they have skipped on this year's April Fools shenanigans, as they didn't want to play with people's feelings by pretending to delay a product release or something of the sort and anything more intricate than that would take time and effort. "The key to a good joke is knowing when not to play a good joke," concluded Randazzo.Â  â The first topic to be brought up is their 737 lineup update, currently under a critical fixes-only development status, given the work on the upcoming 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The latest update (3.00.0092) addresses the fact they accidentally pushed an earlier build instead of the real 3.00.0091, which had stability issues and features that were not quite complete, in Randazzo's own words.Â  The new update should bring it up to parity with the correct build, and it should be out to marketplace users this Friday or around April 11 at the latest. They also apologize for the inconvenience and are still unsure how they managed such a feat.Â  777-wise, Randazzo has shared two images of the long-awaited airline with the PMDG house livery. They have started to add wear and tear to the cockpit, and previews will be shared eventually.Â  Unlike their 737NG, which was a brand new airframe when they conducted their survey, the 777 they based their flight deck on is 12 years old, which they plan on realistically conveying with their texturing. The 747-400, on the other hand, will reflect a heavily used airplane, as their real research counterpart did. They have been working on implementing new features that Randazzo has not yet been allowed to share. Still, he hinted at multiple tablet features, greater sound integration, improved maintenance processes, and more. Robert concludes with great enthusiasm about its imminent release, saying it's very close to being in everyone's hangars and that it might as well be their best release yet. The PMDG 737 lineup is available in theirÂ store, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $69.99. The upcoming 777-300ER's pricing and release date are yet to be revealed.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Crafts have publicly revealed their secret project, Â celebrating the 10th anniversary of their first release for X-Plane: Free E-Jets for X-Plane 12! The free package will feature their older freeware E175 and E195, which were updated, enhanced, and fully optimized for X-Plane 12. The enhancements include a higher resolution map displaying a top-of-descent indication, seamless visualization of ILS deviations using the preview mode while still in LNAV, and more. They emphasize that it will still be far from the real thing, but they have made it much more enjoyable. They are also running a big giveaway to celebrate their new milestone, with a chance to win many of their products and even a ticket to FSExpo 2024. More information is availableÂ here. â The complete changelog with the many changes will be soon posted on theirÂ website, and the expected release date is around the end of April.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
