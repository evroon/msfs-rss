    <title>Cloud Studio Releases Stillwater Regional Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/665e35addd089989a91fc532_sti1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cloud Studio has recently released their rendition of Stillwater Regional Airport (KSWO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Stillwater, Oklahoma, with a yearly average of 33,000 passengers as of 2023.Â  Its story starts in 1929 when Mayor George Thompson secured land north of town. This initial airfield, featuring a half-mile grass runway, a single hangar, and a tiny office, embodied the pioneering spirit of early aviation. J. Alvin "Al" Guthrie, a former barnstormer, took center stage during this era, offering rides, flight lessons, and limited charter services. The airport underwent a significant shift in 1934 with the tragic passing of George Searcy, its manager. His father, M.G. Searcy, briefly took over, and later, Air Force pilot Arthur Kingman renamed the field "Searcy Field" in George's honor. World War II brought a dramatic change. The U.S. Navy leased Searcy Field, transforming it into a training ground for over 1,500 pilots. Interestingly, the airport became a temporary holding facility for nearly 475 surplus military aircraft after the war. In 1946, these planes were sold off, with movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz keeping a dozen for his productions. Stillwater regained control of the airport in 1946. They then leased it to Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University) for a symbolic $1, highlighting the growing importance of aviation in education and research. Commercial air service arrived in 1953 with Central Airlines, eventually merging with Frontier in the late 60s. Their service to Stillwater ceased in 1975, leading to five years of no commercial traffic whatsoever. The hiatus ended in 1980 when Metro Airlines started flights to Oklahoma City using Twin Otters. The year 1977 marked a turning point. Searcy Field officially became Stillwater Municipal Airport, reflecting its growing role in serving the community. Finally, in 1999, it received its current designation â Stillwater Regional Airport â acknowledging its expanding reach. â Today, Stillwater Regional Airport continues to evolve. It offers general aviation services, supports business and commerce, and provides passenger service through American Eagle.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal area, fully custom airport models, 4K textures, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR, and custom orthophoto.Â  It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.10, requiring at least 1.14 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RR Simulations recently released their rendition of Valle de la Pascua Airport (SVVP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Valle de la Pascua, the capital city of the autonomous municipality of Leonardo Infante in Venezuela. There is no public information regarding the airportâs origins, but itâs assumed to have been built around the early 1920s when the Venezuelan commercial aviation industry emerged and urged cities to develop their first airstrips.Â  It has a single 1525-meter runway with no night lighting, meaning it only operates from sunrise to sunset (06:00-18:00). Itâs also VFR only, with no navigational aids whatsoever (its VOR station no longer works).Â  Itâs only served by Conviasa with flights to Caracas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 3D buildings, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, a terminal interior, and a custom GSX profile. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.18, requiring at least 1.19 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>MâM Simulations Releases Vilnius Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/mmsvil"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/665f82921391e52206492f69_vilnius1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MâM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Vilnius Airport (EYVI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the largest airport in Lithuania in terms of passenger volume, with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â It opened in 1932 as Wilno-Porubanek, after Vilnius and Porubanek, a former neighboring village now part of the Kirtimai district. It had a brief commercial stint before WW2 with routes to Warsaw, Vaunas (albeit much later, in 1939), and Riga. Designed by JÃ³zefa MrÃ³wkowa-OchmaÅska, the first passenger terminal was built between 1934 and 1936 in a modernist style. It included a restaurant, a hotel for passengers, a newspaper kiosk, a customs post, a police station, and a post office. At the time, it was heavily criticized for its overly luxurious interior and proportions, which were a bit too optimistic for the then very small traffic figures. During World War 2, it was briefly repurposed as a military airfield, with civil airport duties only resuming in mid-1944. A new terminal was built between 1949 and 1954, featuring a standard Soviet design from the 1950s. It was originally intended for no more than 20 aircraft movements a day. The ever-growing traffic figures led to the construction of a new departure terminal in 1993, which was connected to the old one. In late 2007, a new 1,000-square-meter terminal building was opened, improving its passenger handling capabilities and complying with Schengen requirements. The total area of the terminals was around 3,462 square meters. In early 2023, the government financed yet another departure terminal, which will cover 14,400 square meters of land and double the passenger throughput from 1,200 to 2,400 passengers/hour. Itâs scheduled to open in early 2025. Itâs a hub for airBaltic and a focus city for GetJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Air Montenegro, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Finnair, flydubai, LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Swiss, and Turkish also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom parking positions matching real life, custom surroundings, custom shuttle train, custom night lighting, custom terminal interior, PBR materials, and more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.10, requiring at least 5.61 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FSDG Releases Teruel for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2024-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/letlxp"/>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDG has released their rendition of Teruel Airport (LETL) for X-Plane 12. Officially known as Plataforma Aeroportuaria-Teruel (PLATA), this airport serves as an aircraft storage and maintenance facility for Tarmac Aerosave - a company specialising in aircraft maintenance and storage. After being used as an airfield during the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1939, the location of Teruel Airport was a firing range for the Spanish Air Force for a long time, before plans for a new commercial airport were made. Construction work began in 2009 and after 4 years, Teruel Airport was officially opened in February 2013, after receiving certification from AESA (Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency) for public use. Throughout the years, many more platforms for long-storage were made, increasing the number of available stands from 24 to 84. In 2016, Teruel Airport was one of the few airports that were used in testing of the A400M. During the same year, a flight school opened with a base at Teruel. The latest expansion included the construction of a new parking area. Meteorological conditions, location and low density of traffic made Teruel a perfect place for long-term storage facilities. Aside from Tarmac Aerosave, the Spanish space launch agency, PLD Space, also uses this airport to test launch vehicle technology. FSDGâs rendition of Teruel Airport features an authentic light environment, static aircraft, dynamic lighting, reflective textures, and optimisation for great performance and visual results. This scenery is made for X-Plane 12 but is compatible with X-Plane 11.30+ as well. It is available for purchase on SimMarket for roughly $11.85. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Teikof Studio recently released their rendition of Antonio NariÃ±o Airport (SKPS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Pasto, Colombia, and has a yearly average of 333,600 passengers. The exact date of the airport's construction remains unclear, but its development was driven by the need for improved connectivity in a region known for its mountainous terrain. Building an airport on flat land proved difficult, so engineers opted for a daring solution: constructing a runway on a plateau 50 meters above the surrounding area. This distinctive feature has earned the airport the nickname "aircraft carrier" among pilots, referencing its resemblance to a flat-topped ship on a sea of land. One of its most notable aspects is its runway: due to the high elevation and surrounding terrain, it is relatively short, posing a challenge for larger aircraft. However, significant improvements have been made over the years. Since 2007, the addition of an instrument landing system (ILS) has allowed for safer operations during low visibility and nighttime conditions. âCrosswinds also pose another significant challenge, especially during the summer months. Pilots must possess a high degree of skill and experience to navigate these conditions safely. â Pasto Airport's dependence on good visibility conditions and tame winds will eventually lead to its replacement, as it won't be able to keep up with the projected passenger traffic demand.Â  Avianca (BogotÃ¡, Cali), Clic (Cali), and LATAM Colombia (BogotÃ¡) serve it.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal, custom ground textures, custom terraforming, and more. It's available on the MSFS Marketplace for $9.99.Â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
