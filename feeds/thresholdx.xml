    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlightSim Studios has recently updated the B727 to version 1.0.8, which brings the new Sperry-150 Autopilot, reworked forward pedestal and the Flightplan clipboard. One of the biggest features of this update is the new Sperry-150 autopilot. Produced by the Sperry Flight Dynamics in the 1960s, this rather antique specimen of the autopilot system was capable of following simple tasks such as altitude hold, heading select, IAS/pitch hold, and approach modes. The developers have also included key bindings for the autopilot functions, allowing users to set up the controls to their liking. Another new feature is the update to the GNS-XLS, which now allows the manual entry of airways. The forward pedestal panel also has a new addition - a dummy weather and terrain radar screen. The first update of the year has also brought improved sounds and sound positioning, fuel system overhaul, and the Flightplan clipboard, where you can import your SimBrief flight-plan, and move it between the Flight Engineer station or the forward pedestal, right next to the navigational computer of your choice. The full changelog of bug fixes and new features can be found below:Â  â Improvements: Features: The B727 Freighter can be purchased on the Aerosoft store or the Contrail for roughly $36.20 and requires at least 3.5GB of free disk space â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Flightbeam Studios recently updated their rendition of San Francisco International Airport (KSFO), ensuring compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and introducing enhanced ground textures, performance-optimized assets, built-in native VDGS, and more. The update takes advantage of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs modern SDK to further improve their rendition of San Francisco International, now without barriers imposed by the previous platformâs limitations: it would enforce, for example, a default detail map on all aprons, which is no longer the case, allowing Flightbeam to further increase the quality on the ground textures with higher resolution samples, more oil stains, tire marks and gunk, accurately matching the real counterpart. Furthermore, every single asset in the scenery was re-optimized and re-exported for the best possible performance. It also brings a native VDGS system on A, B, E, and G gates, completely custom taxiway lights with correct runway entry/exit colors, diverse fauna and flora around the airport, and new scanned assets from their multiple visits to SFO in real life. The update is completely free for previous owners, and new purchasers can find it on Contrail for roughly $13.29 (promotional price), requiring at least 2.44 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Navigraph Launches Community Survey 2024</title>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67cb46b8f96abf8d6d17e6cc_survey2024.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph has just launched the seventh edition of their FlightSim Community Survey. The Survey asks various questions about preferred platforms, add-ons, use cases, preferences, etc. It provides great insight into the modern flight sim demographic, thus making it easier for the industry to understand what the simmers really want. Unusually, the Survey was delayed until early 2025 so Navigraph could more comprehensively and accurately capture the community's sentiment due to the large number of major releases near the end of last year. Averaging more than 20,000 respondents since the 2020 edition, the Survey has become the go-to reference for hardware metrics, given it differs massively compared to mainstream reference data such as the Steam Hardware Survey, which takes their entire user base into account. Focusing exclusively on flight simmers, it provides a more accurate image of the most popular hardware among virtual pilots.Â  It also sheds light on the most popular flight sim platform, intent (whether simulating just for fun or training for a pilot's license), simulation proficiency, and how many of us are real-life pilots.Â  The Survey will run for ten days starting today (March 7), and the results will be published shortly after. It is entirely GDPR compliant and fully anonymous, with no personally identifiable data being collected and no redirects.Â  Click here to participate in the world's most comprehensive flight simulation survey!

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/350102"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently issued a new update to their newly released A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing further WASM stability, bug fixes, and two new features. Marked by a controversial launchâwith a creator even asking for a refundâupdate v1.0.2 aims to get their ultimate airliner experience back on track with enhanced WASM stability, a substantial amount of bug fixes, and two new features: the A350 MORA (Minimum Off-Route Altitude) implementation and the Secondary Navigation Display, which provides backup navigation should the primary flight management system be unavailable or degraded. They have also made a note on the many community mods that supposedly improve the A350âs flight model: âComments and updates from the community regarding flight model cfgs are mostly irrelevant, or a placebo effect, as they have little to no effect on how the aircraft performs in sim. We have tuned the plane to fly as closely to real life with the support of our technical working group and A350 pilots teamâ, concluded iniBuilds, while also addressing one of the mod files and their direct impact â or lack thereof â on the flight model: Mod File Feature List: â Major Flight Stability Increases (aircraft should feel much heavier on the controls, will be improved on) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Corrected Reference Speeds (Overspeed Limits increased, set to real values) Overspeed and Cruise Mach iniBuilds: Fixed in v1.01Â  Â  Reduced Thrust Multiplier (lower overall thrust output). iniBuilds: Only effects total thrust. Reducing it as indicated will have a negative/unrealistic impact on SRS Â  Increased Ground Friction (initial roll requires thrust increase) iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback.Â  Â  Reduced Elevator Trim Speed (slightly) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler-on Deploy timing (mostly in-flight, the spoilers seem unaffected) iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Can be adjusted slightly in cfgâs but this is not realistic.Â  Â  Custom Flight Dynamics Overhaul. iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Flare and Rotation Behavior (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Slower Spoiler Deployment (looking into this, may not be needed after V1.0.1). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Fuel Flow Scalar (looking into this). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  Â  Improved Climb-Lift Ratios. iniBuilds: Unrealistic modification as this was tuned as per IRL references and pilot feedback. Â  Brake Changes (higher priority, looking into this also). iniBuilds: This is not possible or true as its controlled via our WASM.Â  â The complete changelog for the update is available here.Â  The A350 Airliner is available for purchase at the iniBuilds Store for roughly $76.16, requiring at least 10.63 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>SimPixel Releases Weeze Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SimPixel has recently released their rendition of Weeze Airport (EDLV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Kreis Kleve (Germany) and Nijmegen (Netherlands) with a yearly average of a million passengers. It was built on top of a preexisting military facility (RAF Laarbruch) and started operating as a civilian airport in 2003. The airportâs name was supposed to be after the city of DÃ¼sseldorf, but it was ruled out due to the distance (83 km) and the fact DÃ¼sseldorf already had two international airports in close proximity (DÃ¼sseldorf Airport and Cologne-Bonn). The name idea was eventually ruled out by the court in 2016 due to the huge potential to mislead passengers. Ryanair still refers to it as DÃ¼sseldorf-Weeze, though. Itâs an operating base for Ryanair, and Sky Express serves it seasonally. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-resolution textures, custom 3d models, dynamic night lighting, detailed interiors, performance-friendly optimization, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $13.02, requiring at least 1.62 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Nuuk Airport (BGGH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Nuuk, Greenland, and has a yearly average of 69,324 passengers. The airport was built in 1979 when the government decided to create a network of STOL-capable domestic airports. It originally featured a 950-meter-long asphalt runway located 86 meters above sea level. The terminal and apron were built on a leveled platform on an undulating slope under a mountain.Â  After many years of expansion proposals, the administration decided to expand the runway to 2,200 meters, build a new terminal to accommodate the expected passenger traffic figures, and expand the apron and service buildings. Construction started in 2019 and reached partial completion in 2022. The new terminal was only inaugurated two years later, in 2024. The scenery accurately depicts the airport, including its new terminal, the 2,200-meter-long runway, handcrafted terrain elevation, detailed 3D terminal with a custom interior, animated objects, custom ground service equipment, up-to-date ground layout, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $16.82, requiring at least 747.95 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Not long after the release of Sim Update 1, the team at Microsoft has launched the in-sim Marketplace for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This Marketplace has been highly anticipated by the community and is now accessible within the simulator. Many items from the Marketplace in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 have been ported to the new simulator. These items should be available in the library and need to be activated. However, content created by Microsoft and Asobo is automatically activated. The Marketplace offers a variety of options. Ported content from the 2020 version to 2024 is marked with a small logo indicating that it is ported. Content upgraded to the 2024 version may have a new price or be available as a free upgrade, and it is also indicated with a logo showing that it has been upgraded. Users can purchase content using Simverse Coins, which is an in-sim currency that can be bought either in the Marketplace or at select retailers. Currently, the Marketplace does not support rentals or gifting, but these features are expected to be introduced with Sim Update 2 in April. Additionally, there are a few known issues with the Marketplace. For the full release notes and details on these issues, please check the official release announcement. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft recently released a new World Update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, which enhances half the landmass of South America with detailed coverage of Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana.Â  They partnered with Bing Maps, Maxar, and Vexcel to craft the update, which features sights ranging from vast dune fields to bustling metropolises. Fusing several types of recent geospatial data, including aerial photographs, satellite imagery, DEM (digital elevation model) data, and DTM (digital terrain model), they managed to concoct a very realistic rendition in real-time. It captures 75 Points of Interest in total, including Fort Diamant in French Guiana, Monte Roraima in Guyana and Brazil, and Brazilâs Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro. It also includes four TIN cities, all in Brazil: Brasilia, Ouro Preto, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo.Â  Gaya Simulations â one of their partners â crafted seven airports: Foz do IguaÃ§u International Airport (SBFI), Fernando de Noronha Airport (SBFN), Santos Dumont (SBRJ), and Santarem - Maestro Wilson Fonseca International Airport (SBSN); Guyanaâs Kaieteur International Airport (SYKA), Surinameâs Zorg en Hoop Airport (SMZO), and French Guianaâs Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni Airport (SOOM). The update also includes three discovery flights, three landing challenges, and three bush trips.Â  New MSFS 2024-only content will be added on March 17th, including a helicopter landing challenge at Mirante Dona Marta (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), a rally race through Rio in an F/A-18, and a low-altitude challenge in an L-39 through the Serra do Corvo Branco, a rugged mountain range in southern Brazil. The update is free for all Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 owners. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

In conjunction with their newly released World Update XIX: Brazil, Suriname, Guyana, and French Guiana, the Microsoft Flight Simulator team is happy to announce a strategic partnership with Embraer, one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world. â "We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Embraer, one of the global aerospace industry leaders," said Jorg Neumann, Microsoft Flight Simulator's lead developer. "Embraer's latest generation fleet and their innovation-driven focus make them a perfect partner for Microsoft Flight Simulator, and our objective is to bring many Embraer aircraft over to the simulator as part of our Expert Series. We are happy to announce that we are starting this collaboration with the widely popular Embraer Praetor 600, which will be released in MSFS sometime this year", he added. â "We are thrilled to share the Praetor 600 with the Microsoft Flight Simulator community.Â  The most innovative executive jet from the Super Midsize category and the most technologically advanced in the world", said Embraer's Marketing Director, Felipe Alfaia, to which he added, "It's a pleasure to see our industry-leading jet landing on the most popular consumer flight simulator of the world near the end of 2025".Â  â The Praetor 600 is a super-midsize jet with the biggest range in the world so far, being able to fly from London to New York or Sao Paulo to Miami. Aside from the superb range, it also brings full fly-by-wire, a highly advanced avionics suite, and an insane degree of connectivity, making it one of the most technologically advanced airplanes in its class. Its interior fully uses the cabin's dimensions, ensuring no space is wasted with six foldable seats, custom tiles, and a vacuum-operated lavatory system. â Furthermore, the Praetor 600 also brings a turbulence reduction system, a highly silent cabin, a large cargo capacity for baggage, and a comprehensively sized wardrobe in the rear bathroom. â There is no further information regarding pricing or features, but Threshold will keep you informed!

    <title>Meridian GMT Announces Brand; Product Announcement</title>
    <updated>2025-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67d1913052f024653fd52772_meridian%20banner.jpeg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The world of flight simulation hardware welcomes a significant new player today - Meridian GMT. At the helm is Nicki Repenning, a name long familiar to the simulation community through his former role as founder and public face of Honeycomb Aeronautical. While Repenningâs earlier work helped establish some of the most widely adopted peripherals in the sector, Meridian GMT is attempting a distinct break from the past - a clean-slate approach grounded in new principles, or rather, on their terms. Repenning played a central role in bringing to life the Honeycomb Alpha Flight Controls, Bravo Throttle Quadrant, and Charlie Rudder Pedals - devices that saw widespread acclaim for their feature set and accessibility. However, Honeycombâs legacy is not without complications. Despite its disruptive design, price point, and popularity, the Bravo Throttle faced recurring quality concerns, such as cable issues and mechanical wear, which were highlighted in long-term user experiences. Furthermore, the very protracted delivery timeline for the Charlie Rudder Pedals and the outright conflict between Repenning and his former business partner Mike Steup from Snakebyte Group, a German product development company, over the ownership and direction of Honeycomb, left a permanent mark on the brandâs reputation. That conflict was central to the community's growing distrust towards Repenning and the Honeycomb name. These challenges were not unnoticed. Community discourse and critical media coverage, including our own reporting at Threshold, explored the implications of Honeycombâs faltering transparency and logistical setbacks. Our piece "Into the Hive: Updates on Honeycomb's Journey", we provided a deep dive into the frustrations voiced by customers and the broader lessons for hardware developers in the flight sim industry. It should be noted that while Honeycomb eventually fulfilled the Charlie pre-orders, the extended wait, poor support, and surrounding controversy left the brand tainted in the eyes of many. Today, however, marks a turning point. Meridian GMT positions itself not as a continuation of Honeycomb but as a new venture with its own values, structure, and trajectory. While Repenningâs experience is undeniable, Meridian is shaped by a conscious intent to move beyond prior missteps. A more modular design philosophy, increased repairability, a tighter internal team, and strategic outsourcing of non-core competencies reflect this new direction. The companyâs first product presentation will take place this coming weekend. Repenning will take the stage at FSWeekend and reveal three hardware products that aim to set new standards across their respective categories. Until then, the full product lineup remains under wraps. As stated in Meridian GMTâs official press release today on their website. "Meridian GMT is more than just a brand; it's a commitment to the flight simulation community", said Repenning. âOur core values - innovation, precision, durability, and affordability - are at the heart of everything we do. Our mission is to deliver hardware that not only exceeds the expectations of the community but also makes products for the casual flight simmer, embarking on their first solo flight, and bring immersion and fun to their experience too". The brandâs identity is also symbolically constructed. Meridian says the logo reflects its mission: three diamonds representing Community, Industry Partnerships, and Innovation, set within a golden hexagon signifying Legacy. The inverted Y in the logo nods to aviation roots, with a subtle aircraft silhouette formed by the space between the diamonds. While the past casts a long shadow, Meridian GMT is determined to navigate new horizons - without relying on nostalgia or name recognition to carry its message. Â Instead, they hope to enter the market with clear eyes, tempered expectations, and a commitment to better serve the simulation community. The brandâs story begins hereâand what follows will be watched with interest. </summary>
