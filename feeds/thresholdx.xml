    <title>Just Flight Releases Development Update for RJ Professional</title>
    <updated>2024-08-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight have released another development update on their website for an upcoming product for MSFS - RJ Professional. â The newest update focuses on the cabin and all the differences in cabins between BAe 146 and RJ. The cabin in RJ is also modelled in a 3-3 seat layout, although with grey leather seats, compared to the blue fabric seats in the 146 version.Â  The cabins are custom-modelled for each variant of RJ (RJ70, RJ85 and RJ100), and take all the small differences between them into account, such as blanked-out windows, smaller stowage bins where the wing structure and fuel tanks are located, as well as reduction of seats in rows as the fuselage starts narrowing at the rear. As usual, Just Flight developers have modelled and coded the smallest details in the cabin - both forward and aft galleys are interactive, cabin-to-cockpit communication, and of course, the beloved âstudy-levelâ coffee-maker.Â  The changes in the galley were also made. The bulky communication panel that can be found in 146 Professional is replaced with a simple handset in RJ Professional. Using the headset, you can call the rear or forward galley, cockpit, or passenger cabin. Chimes and annunciators are also included at each station. On the right-hand side of the cabin, the attendant panel can be found. It is used to check the status of the doors, turn on/off seatbelts and no smoking signs, and connect the cabin with the electrical power supplied by the GPU. The layout of this panel is different in RJ, as there are two additional switches that control the cabin lighting. If you arenât a big fan of getting involved in the passenger simulation, developers have you covered! The EFB will include an option named âAuto Cabin Crewâ, and when enabled, the virtual cabin crew will automatically take care of all cabin duties, while you prepare the aircraft for the flight. Speaking of the cabin duties, the boarding and deboarding music will be played via the cool little digital player, which is also in 146 Professional. It allows you to play one of seven default tunes, while you can add your own custom music if you fancy full immersion while flying real-world flights, or just want to relax in the cabin during the cruise with your favourite songs. According to the developers, the rest of the product is finished and has entered the âpolishingâ phase, where RJ will undergo intensive testing and ensure that it is ready for release. Unfortunately, no information about the release date or pricing has been released, but as always, Threshold will keep you updated! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Publishes Introduction to A319/A321 Expansion for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/319321"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66be4843f29db92c859ea0b2_fenixcover1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations recently published an in-depth blog post about their upcoming A319/A321 expansion package for Microsoft Flight Simulator, covering historical bits, differences, catches, flight model changes, and more. The first few paragraphs explain why the Airbus A320 came to be and who it was trying to compete against. They then eventually delve into the length differences of each airframe and the many challenges encountered during development, spanning from wingspan to engine thrust and even noise restrictions.Â  From there onwards, they also went on in detail about the flight model differences between both, with the A321 suffering to slow down and the A319 slowing down far too much, and how that differs from what one would expect based on their experience flying the A320.Â  The differences donât stop there, though, with the A321 demanding an entirely different landing technique due to its weight and length, significantly increasing the risk of a tailstrike in case of an overflare, and the A319 being the exact opposite due to its 13.5-degree tailstrike clearance.Â  While the A319 and A320 share the same fuel system, the A321 has an entirely different layout, using a single, large tank per wing instead of the split-wing design on the smaller siblings. The electrical center tank pumps were replaced by transfer jet pumps, using motive flow to extract fuel from the center tank and move it to the wing tanks. Such a difference makes it so the fuel logic is far from being the same, which they exemplify in a pretend failure scenario, with the A321 being able to have its pumps working - gravitationally -Â  even in case of an electrical supply failure, whereas the A319/A320 would not. The ECAM, which is the central nervous system of a modern Airbus, is also objectively different across the variants. Fenix has gone through extensive documentation to ensure accurate ECAM behavior with every possible variant, as certain combinations are exclusive to each type. â The ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer), SEC (Spoiler and Elevator Computers), and FAC (Flight Augmentation Computers) were also altered for A319/A321 conformity, as they are also intrinsically different. â Their cabin announcement system was changed to support the upcoming expansion, making type-specific cabin announcements possible. â Fenix has also fed their systems with new data, warranting accurate green dot, VLS computation, and performance application updates to provide proper takeoff and landing distance calculations. â Each airframe will accompany its own GSX profile, ensuring compatibility with FSDTâs Ground Service X from day one. â The flight model has undergone massive changes, with a rewritten control translation system that is faster, more performant, and more accurate, running literally 100x faster than before. The âdelayâ on control input that many users complained about is now a thing of the past. That tweak led them to retune the fly-by-wire logic entirely, with changes to the Alpha Protection PIDs, a complete autopilot rework, and some of the code had to be altered to accommodate the new changes. When flying the aircraft by hand, the outcome is a more natural, direct, and âconnectedâ feel. â Their flare logic has also been given attention, with the ground effect completely externalized. This gives Fenix Simulations full control over the landing dynamics, ensuring the aircraftâs behavior on the landing and flare portion is closer to the actual thing. â They highlight that the handling upgrades will also be made available for the A320 on launch day instead of an open-ended promise to back-port the new features âeventually.âÂ  â The new engines will also follow their XEM (external engine model) system, with all airframes having unique engine variants and thrust ratings. The A319 will feature the CFM56-5B6 engines for the -112 variant and the IAE V2524-A5 SelectOne for the -132. The A321, on the other hand, will feature the CFM56-5B2 engines for the -213 variant and the IAE V2533-A5 SelectOne for the -231. Their new flight model was built on hundreds of hours of telemetry data fed by their beta team and then compared with real-world performance data, yielding a âwonderfully accurateâ result with convincing drag, lift, thrust, flap settings, geometry, fuel flow, ground handling, and gyroscopic precision.Â  â They have also solved an issue where their Airbus would lose stability when fully configured and flying close to VLS, often âdropping a wing.â That has since been addressed, and one should be able to fly an extremely heavy A321 fully configured in a tight visual circuit without having a wing drop anymore. These improvements will also be applied to the A320 on launch day. â Thereâs no information about the release date yet, but their next development update will showcase some new liveries for the upcoming birds.

    <title>SimPixel Releases Bari Karol WojtyÅa Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/splibd"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66bf777fd7e2f9b4dc325850_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimPixel has recently released their version of Bari Karol WojtyÅa Airport (LIBD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport is located in the Italian city of Bari, about 5 miles from the city center. In 2023, the airport handled just under 6.5 million passengers, making it the 10th busiest airport in Italy. The airport was originally built as a military airfield and opened in the 1930s. It was seized during the Second World War and began receiving civil flights in the 1960s. Alitalia was one of the first airlines to fly to the airport, offering routes to Rome, Catania, Palermo, Ancona, and Venice. In 1981, a new passenger terminal was built, and in 1990, the airport underwent a runway extension and terminal upgrade. Another renovation took place in 2000, resulting in the construction of a new passenger terminal, which was completed in 2005. Today, the airport serves as a hub for various airlines including easyJet, Ryanair, and Volotea, offering a wide range of destinations across the world. With approximately 6.5 million passengers and 50.000 aircraft movements yearly, the airport continues to be a vital transportation hub. The newly released version of Bari Karol WojtyÅa Airport boasts a range of features, such as high-resolution textures, custom 3D models, dynamic lighting, detailed interiors, static aircraft, ground vehicles, and more. The add-on requires 2.94 GB of storage space and is available on iniBuilds for around $16.7. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>XWind Studios Announces Trenton-Mercer Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xwitre"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66bfa7fb66a9852f1acfe6e7_trenton1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently announced the development of Trenton-Mercer Airport (KTTN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This joint civil-military airport serves Trenton in New Jersey and has a yearly average of 917,000 passengers. The airportâs history is more than a century old. Its first airplane landing was in 1907 when it was just a small airfield on Alfred Reederâs farm. It was opened to the public in 1929 as Skillman Airport. It was used for aircraft testing during World War 2 when a nearby General Motors factory switched from building cars to Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers for the United States Navy. The facility was greatly expanded to accommodate the testing needs. After the end of the war, it was returned to the county and renamed Mercer County Airport. However, it remained partially military, with a Naval Air Warfare Center, which only closed in 1997. The airportâs name was changed again in 1995 to its current name (Trenton-Mercer Airport), after the city of Trenton, which is the state capital and county seat of Mercer County. Many plans were made to replace the old terminal, which residents along the flight path opposed. As a compromise, they renovated it in 2013, bringing it up to standard.Â  An eventual replacement was finally drafted in 2021, considering environmental concerns, and with 125,000 square feet of total area instead of 24,780 from the old one. FAA approved the project a year later, and the terminal was set to reach completion by mid-to-late 2024, but construction had yet to start by May 2024.Â  Itâs served by Frontier Airlines, with flights to Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa.Â  â The scenery will feature custom ground textures, custom buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, and more.Â  Thereâs no release date or pricing information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After their recent introduction of the upcoming Fenix A319 &amp; A321 expansion, the team has just released a new post featuring a variety of liveries and art previews. The developer has also provided details about the release window for the new expansion. The team has rebuilt the fuselage textures from the ground up for the new expansion. For example, the A319 will now have stronger skin deformation on the airframe due to being in a higher pressurisation cycle state. The team has also provided a screenshot clearly showing these changes both below and above the cockpit windows on the A319. Additionally, the team informed us about their decision to offer both dual overwing exit and single overwing emergency exit options on the A319. This choice was made to provide users with the most realistic experience, allowing them to replicate real-life aircraft configurations used by specific airlines. Implementing this new option required the team to update reflections on the ECAM, cabin artwork, wing layout, and other related aspects. When it comes to the A321, the team had to make a decision. This time, the choice was between a two-class or single-class layout for the A321. Again, the team decided to include both layouts and the option to change between them, similar to the A319's overwing exit option. The team has confirmed that the new window textures are included, along with the unique double-slotted flaps on the A321. Additionally, they have shared a video comparing the full TOGA on the various aircraft versions with their respective CFM versions. As of now, the livery manager boasts a total of 450 liveries, with even more on the way. Lastly, the team has announced that the highly anticipated A319 &amp; A321 expansion will launch next week. Once more information is available, or the expansion has been released, Threshold will keep you updated. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Airwil Sceneries recently released their rendition of Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport (RPVA) for X-Plane 11 and 12. This airport serves Tacloban, the Philippines, and has a yearly average of 1.5 million passengers.Â  It was constructed as an airstrip for the US Air Force during World War 2, housing multiple bombing and fighter units throughout the conflict. It was converted into a commercial airport soon after and renamed from San Jose Airstrip to Tacloban National Airport. In late 2013, Typhoon Haiyan demolished the terminal and the control tower, leading to a reconstruction effort. A few days later, it reopened for turboprop aircraft, and by November 14, it could already welcome narrowbody jets such as the 738 and A320. The passenger terminal was expanded in 2017 to accommodate the ever-growing passenger traffic figures, adding 1,100 square meters of floor area and an additional 275 seats in the pre-departure area, raising the total to 635. This sufficed for at least three simultaneous flights, whereas it could just barely handle two beforehand. Approval for the construction of a new terminal, capable of handling up to 1,670 passengers/hour, was granted in 2020. Construction started that same year and is halfway complete as of early 2023.Â  Itâs served by Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, PAL Express, and Philippines AirAsia. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom POIs, custom ground clutter, custom interiors, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $11.66, requiring at least 3.76GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>SoFly Announces Cardiff Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SoFly has recently announced the development and imminent release of Cardiff Airport (EGFF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Cardiff, Wales, with a yearly average of 859,000 passengers. It was built as RAF Rhoose in 1941 and started operations a year later as the home grounds for the No 53 Operational Training Unit, which trained future Spitfire pilots for World War 2 and beyond. It was abandoned right after World War 2, only to be brought back to life in the early 1950s after the Minister of Civil Aviation brought up his wish to build an airport in South Wales. After much deliberation between the options, they decided to repair the abandoned RAF station and invest whatever was necessary to convert it into a commercial airport.Â  It was then inaugurated in 1952 as Rhoose Airport, with Aer Lingus being the first to start scheduled commercial service routes from their base in Dublin. Flights from the former main airport in Cardiff (Pengam Moors) were transferred to Rhoose in 1954, featuring flights to France, Belfast, and Cork.Â  In early 1965, the airport was transferred to Glamorgan City Council, which started a five-year development plan that included a new tower, a new terminal building, and a runway extension. The runway was further extended in the 1980s, marking its renaming as Cardiff-Wales Airport. The new extension attracted British Airwaysâ attention, as it could accommodate their Boeing 747s for maintenance.Â  â A 100 million pound development strategy was announced in 2005, aiming to extend and upgrade the terminal. It was anticipated that it would attract up to 5 million passengers within a decade, a 150% increase. Only 3 million pounds were actually spent, half funded by the Welsh Government, refurbishing and redeveloping the passenger terminal. Further upgrade work was carried out in 2017 at an extra 4 million pounds. â Aer Lingus, KLM, Loganair, Play, Ryanair, TUI Airways, and Vueling serve it. â The upcoming scenery promises an accurate rendition of the airport, with an animated hangar, full GSX compatibility, highly detailed custom models, custom ground texturing, custom terminal interiors, and more. â Itâs set to release next Thursday (the 29th) for roughly $15.71.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The X-Plane developer software âWorldEditorâ has just received an update. The main portion of the update is set to bring new features for X-Plane scenery developers. The software is a key tool for devs, allowing them to modify and customize existing airports in X-Plane. One of the features to come with this update is the ability to now offer dual jetways. Each jetway can be assigned to a door on the aircraft, reducing the chances of jetways clipping through each other. In addition, devs can also export polygonal data (with exclusions) to third-party software to help design custom scenery elevations. Other minor updates include Shape Entities, Non-integer spacing for strings and tiles shader effects on ground textures. Finally, the team have added the feature to manually create 3D terrain. This feature was showcased on the iconic island of Saba and St Barths in the caribbean. Both airports have terrain around them that causes difficultly when departing or arriving. With all these new features, we can hope to see new sceneries being created for X-Plane, with high quality and exciting new options.Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news, and remember to join our Discord Server!</summary>

    <title>Aerosoft Release Further Previews of Frankfurt Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/arfpfa"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66ca097c9e4cb3970791d815_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. After receiving the trailer in April this year, Areosoft has been hard at work developing their rendition of Frankfurt Main Airport. The team have released the second part of their interview to discuss progress. The video showcases the terminal interiors, airfield night lighting and some features that lie to the south of the airport. The video started with the team discussing how important being in touch with the real airport has been in development. The connection allowed them to stay accurate throughout the ground layout. The interior of an addon scenery plays an important role in improving the level of detail. 3D interiors create a depth of feel when pilots are parked on the stand. The team mentioned that it will not be 100% accurate as that level of detail will require an increase in resources and a reduction in performance. In addition, time spent modelling interiors could be spent on other finer details of the airport. The next portion of the video discusses night lighting. One challenge they faced was the vast amount of lights to be placed around the airport and the location they have. An interesting fact is that Frankfurt features over 40 different floodlights. Each has been modelled differently by the team. An approach into Runway 25R, will showcase the vast terminal and perimeter lighting system. The final portion of the video showcased some of the features you can find to the south of the airport. The largest apron is used by the Lufthansa Technical team, with most of the maintenance on Lufthansas fleet taking place there. Also, a new general aviation ramp to the southwest of the airport allows the flow of small aircraft operations. As the team close in on development, we will keep a close eye on the progress and make sure to provide the latest news!Â  â Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold and join our Discord Server.</summary>
