    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fly2High has recently released its rendition of Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (KSAV) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Savannah, Georgia, and Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, and as of 2023, it had a yearly average of 3.9 million passengers. The airport was built in the early 1940s on a 600-acre piece of land near Cherokee Hill, with three 3600-foot runways covering all possible wind options. The US Army Air Corps soon took it over as a bomber and training base for B-24 bombers and fighter aircraft. It was temporarily named Chatham Airfield, and its infrastructure greatly improved during that short period. Post WW2, it was turned over to the Georgia Air National Guard and renamed Travis Field after a late local Brigadier General, victim of a fatal B-29 accident in California. â â A new airline terminal was built in 1958, and runway extension work followed in 1962, preparing the airport for the jet age. In 1994, a brand new terminal was built, with eight gates and expansion possibilities. Five departure gates were dutifully added in 2007.Â  It won #1 Best Domestic Airport two years in a row (2021 and 2022) in Travel+Leisure Worldâs Best Awards. The method was a survey among the readers that took accessibility, shopping, check-in, restaurants, cleanliness, and many other factors into account. The airportâs domestic popularity was also reinforced by CondÃ© Nast Traveler, which ranked it the best in the United States for three years in a row. Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air and served by American Airlines, American Eagle, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, hand-made ground textures, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, custom jetways, and more. â Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.15, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Gate15Scenery has recently released the second version of its Rishiri Airport (RJER) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the entirety of Rishiri Island in Hokkaido Prefecture and has a yearly average of 38.000 passengers. The airport was built in the late 1960s when air travel was gaining momentum in Japan, and connecting remote islands became a priority. Initially, the airport served a limited number of flights, primarily connecting Rishiri to the nearby Wakkanai Airport on the mainland. However, its presence proved crucial in boosting tourism and facilitating the transportation of goods and services. The airport also became a vital link for emergency medical services, ensuring timely access to specialized care for the island's residents. Over the years, Rishiri Airport has witnessed steady growth. The runway was extended in 1990 to accommodate larger aircraft, allowing for more direct flights and increased passenger capacity. Today, the airport serves several domestic destinations, including Sapporo and Tokyo, making travel to and from the island more convenient. Beyond its role in transportation, Rishiri Airport has become a symbol of the island's connection to the broader world. It serves as a gateway for visitors to experience the island's natural beauty, from the majestic Mount Rishiri to its diverse marine life. It's currently only served by ANA Wings and Hokkaido Air System, with flights to Sapporo (Chitose and Okadama). The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a terminal interior, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Owners of the previous version are eligible for a free upgrade. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.38, requiring at least 298.89 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Cloud Studio Releases Stillwater Regional Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/closti"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/665e35addd089989a91fc532_sti1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cloud Studio has recently released their rendition of Stillwater Regional Airport (KSWO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Stillwater, Oklahoma, with a yearly average of 33,000 passengers as of 2023.Â  Its story starts in 1929 when Mayor George Thompson secured land north of town. This initial airfield, featuring a half-mile grass runway, a single hangar, and a tiny office, embodied the pioneering spirit of early aviation. J. Alvin "Al" Guthrie, a former barnstormer, took center stage during this era, offering rides, flight lessons, and limited charter services. The airport underwent a significant shift in 1934 with the tragic passing of George Searcy, its manager. His father, M.G. Searcy, briefly took over, and later, Air Force pilot Arthur Kingman renamed the field "Searcy Field" in George's honor. World War II brought a dramatic change. The U.S. Navy leased Searcy Field, transforming it into a training ground for over 1,500 pilots. Interestingly, the airport became a temporary holding facility for nearly 475 surplus military aircraft after the war. In 1946, these planes were sold off, with movie stunt pilot Paul Mantz keeping a dozen for his productions. Stillwater regained control of the airport in 1946. They then leased it to Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University) for a symbolic $1, highlighting the growing importance of aviation in education and research. Commercial air service arrived in 1953 with Central Airlines, eventually merging with Frontier in the late 60s. Their service to Stillwater ceased in 1975, leading to five years of no commercial traffic whatsoever. The hiatus ended in 1980 when Metro Airlines started flights to Oklahoma City using Twin Otters. The year 1977 marked a turning point. Searcy Field officially became Stillwater Municipal Airport, reflecting its growing role in serving the community. Finally, in 1999, it received its current designation â Stillwater Regional Airport â acknowledging its expanding reach. â Today, Stillwater Regional Airport continues to evolve. It offers general aviation services, supports business and commerce, and provides passenger service through American Eagle.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal area, fully custom airport models, 4K textures, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR, and custom orthophoto.Â  It's available on SimMarket for roughly $14.10, requiring at least 1.14 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RR Simulations recently released their rendition of Valle de la Pascua Airport (SVVP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Valle de la Pascua, the capital city of the autonomous municipality of Leonardo Infante in Venezuela. There is no public information regarding the airportâs origins, but itâs assumed to have been built around the early 1920s when the Venezuelan commercial aviation industry emerged and urged cities to develop their first airstrips.Â  It has a single 1525-meter runway with no night lighting, meaning it only operates from sunrise to sunset (06:00-18:00). Itâs also VFR only, with no navigational aids whatsoever (its VOR station no longer works).Â  Itâs only served by Conviasa with flights to Caracas. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 3D buildings, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, a terminal interior, and a custom GSX profile. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.18, requiring at least 1.19 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MâM Simulations has recently released their rendition of Vilnius Airport (EYVI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the largest airport in Lithuania in terms of passenger volume, with a yearly average of 5 million passengers. â It opened in 1932 as Wilno-Porubanek, after Vilnius and Porubanek, a former neighboring village now part of the Kirtimai district. It had a brief commercial stint before WW2 with routes to Warsaw, Vaunas (albeit much later, in 1939), and Riga. Designed by JÃ³zefa MrÃ³wkowa-OchmaÅska, the first passenger terminal was built between 1934 and 1936 in a modernist style. It included a restaurant, a hotel for passengers, a newspaper kiosk, a customs post, a police station, and a post office. At the time, it was heavily criticized for its overly luxurious interior and proportions, which were a bit too optimistic for the then very small traffic figures. During World War 2, it was briefly repurposed as a military airfield, with civil airport duties only resuming in mid-1944. A new terminal was built between 1949 and 1954, featuring a standard Soviet design from the 1950s. It was originally intended for no more than 20 aircraft movements a day. The ever-growing traffic figures led to the construction of a new departure terminal in 1993, which was connected to the old one. In late 2007, a new 1,000-square-meter terminal building was opened, improving its passenger handling capabilities and complying with Schengen requirements. The total area of the terminals was around 3,462 square meters. In early 2023, the government financed yet another departure terminal, which will cover 14,400 square meters of land and double the passenger throughput from 1,200 to 2,400 passengers/hour. Itâs scheduled to open in early 2025. Itâs a hub for airBaltic and a focus city for GetJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air. Aegean Airlines, Air Montenegro, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Finnair, flydubai, LOT, Lufthansa, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, Smartwings, Swiss, and Turkish also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom parking positions matching real life, custom surroundings, custom shuttle train, custom night lighting, custom terminal interior, PBR materials, and more. Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.10, requiring at least 5.61 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FSDG Releases Teruel for X-Plane 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDG has released their rendition of Teruel Airport (LETL) for X-Plane 12. Officially known as Plataforma Aeroportuaria-Teruel (PLATA), this airport serves as an aircraft storage and maintenance facility for Tarmac Aerosave - a company specialising in aircraft maintenance and storage. After being used as an airfield during the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1939, the location of Teruel Airport was a firing range for the Spanish Air Force for a long time, before plans for a new commercial airport were made. Construction work began in 2009 and after 4 years, Teruel Airport was officially opened in February 2013, after receiving certification from AESA (Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency) for public use. Throughout the years, many more platforms for long-storage were made, increasing the number of available stands from 24 to 84. In 2016, Teruel Airport was one of the few airports that were used in testing of the A400M. During the same year, a flight school opened with a base at Teruel. The latest expansion included the construction of a new parking area. Meteorological conditions, location and low density of traffic made Teruel a perfect place for long-term storage facilities. Aside from Tarmac Aerosave, the Spanish space launch agency, PLD Space, also uses this airport to test launch vehicle technology. FSDGâs rendition of Teruel Airport features an authentic light environment, static aircraft, dynamic lighting, reflective textures, and optimisation for great performance and visual results. This scenery is made for X-Plane 12 but is compatible with X-Plane 11.30+ as well. It is available for purchase on SimMarket for roughly $11.85.</summary>
