    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Developer iBlueYonder has released its latest scenery for X-Plane 12: Dallas Love Field (KDAL). Situated just over 5 nautical miles from downtown Dallas, this Texan airport accommodates more than 16 million passengers annually. Opened in 1917, the airport initially served as a training base for the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. Following the war, it continued as a military air base until the City of Dallas purchased it in 1927, marking the beginning of civilian operations, with commercial flights starting shortly thereafter. During World War II, the airport was again utilized by the military. After the war, commercial traffic at the airport saw significant growth. Over the years, the airport has undergone various expansions and improvements. Today, it operates as a base for Southwest Airlines and JSX while also serving Delta Airlines. These airlines facilitate nearly 250,000 aircraft operations each year, handling over 16 million passengers. The scenery includes features such as a complete representation of the airport, a skyline of Dallas City, a detailed terminal interior, custom night lighting, hand-placed vegetation, and more. The newly released scenery is now available from SimMarket for approximately $21.16. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published a new development update concerning the arrival of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024âs Sim Update 2 and what it means to their product line and upcoming updates. According to Robert Randazzo, the update caught them off guard as they were preparing an update to make the 777F compatible with 24 and another update for the newly released 777-200ER (for both platforms). They were already getting the cloud services to distribute the files, but SU2 has temporarily halted it. The new SDK changes with SU 2 introduce a bunch of auditing features that threw many warnings on their 777, which they had to spend plenty of time (until this morning) fixing. However, as they donât want any extra surprises, it was decided that it would be best to send the update over to the testing team to make sure everything is okay before actually rolling out an update. â They anticipate the 777F going live on Monday for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024; the same applies to the 777-200ER update. â The 777-300ER update for MSFS 2024 is still on track for next week, even though they ran into this little roadblock with the 777F. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Southwest Florida International Airport (KRSW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Fort Myers and Southwest Florida and has a yearly average of 11 million passengers. RSW was built to replace Fort Myers' former main airport, Page Field, as it was considered too small and difficult to expand due to certain constraints (like a major highway, for example), starting anew elsewhere seemed the better idea. Construction started in 1980, and the airport was inaugurated on schedule three years later. It featured an 8400-foot runway and a terminal with 14 gates on two concourses. In 1993, a 50,000-square-foot Federal Inspection facility was annexed to the main concourse, and the runway was lengthened to 12,000 feet to better accommodate international service. The terminal underwent expansion in 1998 to keep up with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel. A new wing and three additional gates were added to Concourse B. An entirely new terminal project, with three concourses and 28 gates, started in 2002. Part of the original terminal had to be demolished to make room for the new one. It's an operating base for Breeze Airways, and served by Air Canada Rouge, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Discover Airlines, Frontier Airlines, JetBlue, Porter Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, an official GSX profile, custom high-grade aerial imagery, basic interiors for performance, and much more. It's available on Contrail for roughly $18.00, requiring at least 3.82 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDGâs Boeing 777F Now Available for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently made its Boeing 777F fully compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which is now available through the new Operations Center for 2020 owners. After a few days of struggling with SU 2 (as per their last development update), PMDG has finally managed to get the 777F working properly in the new simulator. It is the first of the pre-2024 777s to get compatibility.Â  Owners of the 2020 version do not need to repurchase the addon, and new purchases will grant you the two versions. Furthermore, PMDG will submit the 777F to the in-game marketplace for intake, a process that is known to take a couple of weeks. The 2020 version also got an update, as it hasnât been updated in a while, thanks to PMDG being busy with the 777-200ER. The changes include code optimizations, flight model and fly-by-wire improvements, systems updates, and bug fixes, along with new features such as the weight and balance application, and the inclusion of the SayIntentions datalink integration to both the 777-200ER and the 777F.Â  The 777-300ER is currently in testing for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and might become available later this week, but that will require further evaluation, and it is possible that it will only be ready next week. Regarding their next product, the 777L is being prepared for entry into testing, and they expect that to begin by the end of May. The addon is available at their store for $54.99.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph recently issued an update to its flight planning tool, SimBrief, adding an advanced thunderstorm avoidance system, a new route calculation engine, and more. SimBriefâs latest versionâsubscriber-only, thoughâadded a wealth of features that, according to Navigraph, beat real-life dispatching tools even before the update.Â  With their all-new route calculator, itâs now possible to avoid specific SIGMETs along the way and plan a path around the weather. Furthermore, avoiding temporary flight restriction or ETOPS areas is also a breeze. ETOPS area avoidance makes it easier for people intending to replicate certain ferry flights on non-ETOPS-certified airplanes, providing them with a realistic and safe route.Â  In addition to these new features, you can now easily add oceanic tracks, instantly preview the route before its generation, choose specific SIDs and STARs from a dropdown list on the route calculator, and visualize them on the interactive map before ultimately picking one. â Non-subscribers have not been forgotten, and they received three new updates: a flight history overhaul, expanded aircraft options, and easier equipment editing. â The update is available right now and accessible through their website or app. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Verticalsim recently posted an announcement on its Facebook page concerning the cancellation of their Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (KFLL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 due to various factors. âThis wasnât an easy decision,â they said, âespecially with much of the work already completed, but - after careful reflection - I believe itâs the right one.â The ever-rising expectations for Microsoft Flight Simulator sceneries, their lack of reference material for the airport, and shifting market demands have made the project non-viable and impractical to continue.Â  â Furthermore, their commitment to delivering high-standard scenery that meets or exceeds expectations would not be compatible with delivering KFLL, as they like to take their time to do things right and never cut corners.Â  â Verticalsim will now focus on completing Palm Beach International Airport (KPBI) and outlining a clear roadmap for 2025, âdelivering high-quality airports that I know I can bring the community the right way.â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

Aerosoft recently delineated its development roadmap for 2025, which so far comprises a DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (EDDL) backport to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, optimization work for Frankfurt Airport (EDDF), and a rendition of Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG). â Due to popular demand, Aerosoft has decided to backport their newly released DÃ¼sseldorf Airport to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. They appear to have found a solution to make the scenery backward compatible, even though it was built from the ground up with the new technology in mind. â All 2024 version customers will get the 2020 version free of charge, and they will ensure it also applies to Marketplace customers. Due to certain core differences, they will be provided as separate installations. â Their Mega Airport Frankfurt is undergoing heavy optimization work, with the LOD levels being revised, improved memory and CPU utilization, optimization of all 3D models and textures, and better balance between LOD and FPS. Furthermore, they will also be working on implementing Terminal 3 and updating the ground layout to reflect the latest changes. The update is going to be free for all current owners. â They have also announced a rendition of Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (and maybe 2020, if their backporting process works as intended). They promise a heavily optimized flagship scenery with a large scope, ambition, and transparent step-by-step development process. â Lastly, they announced a rendition of Stuttgart Airport (EDDS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (which may be backported depending on demand), developed by Jo Erlend and Lukas Vezyroglou. Itâs said to be already in development and will feature a highly detailed implementation focused on realism and atmosphere. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Microsoft has recently confirmed its attendance at Expo AviaÃ§Ã£o Virtual 2025, South Americaâs first flight simulation exposition. Now, in its second editionâwith a much larger scopeâit expects up to 2000 visitors within its two-day run and a much larger number of speakers and brands. The first edition welcomed big names in the industry, such as PMDG, Say Intentions AI, Azul Airlines, and popular scenery developers from Brazil (Geardown Simulations, Flyt Simulations). They intended on expanding their international reach for 2025, with Microsoft now confirming their presence. Talks are still in place with other global leaders in simulation and training. Over 14 expert speakers are already confirmed at the event, including many Brazilian aviation figures from both the simulation and real-life spectrum, sharing their experience and knowledge with all the attendees.Â  The event stands out for their inclusive approach, offering a half-price ticket to attendees who donate one kilogram of non-perishable food, which will be donated to charity. Furthermore, they will be welcoming deaf pilots who will share their stories with the audience.Â  â Expo AviaÃ§Ã£o Virtual will be held between November 22 and 23 at Shopping Center 3, Avenida Paulista, 2064, SÃ£o Paulo.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Majestic Software has made their first public appearance in a long while with fiveÂ render images of their upcoming Bombardier Q400, a popular turboprop airliner widely used in North America and Europe. Announced during the early days of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, the Q400 project hasnât seen much tangible information other than the occasional âwe are working on it,â but Majestic has finally taken a bold step, showing renders of their project (still not in-sim, though). They say they will be sharing in-sim screenshots when it is permissible to do so. It is also not yet known whether it will be available for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, 2024, or both, but Threshold will keep you informed.
