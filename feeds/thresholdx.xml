    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published their first development update of the year, which includes further information on the progress of porting their current product line over to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, their upcoming 777-200ER, and more. They are still waiting for Asobo to address specific issues with MSFS 2024 that seem to be blocking the conversion for the time being (memory allocation issues, instability, etc). They have forwarded their findings to the development team and hope these fixes will be made available by SU1.Â  While they hope that SU1 will allow them to work with MSFS 2024, they are not entirely optimistic yet: âIn our experience, there is still downside risk that getting these two fixes rolled into the platform might simply move us forward a few spots, so that we can crack our shins on the next obstacle,â explained Randazzo. The plans for product line compatibility remain similar, with the DC-6 being made compatible yet not bringing any new features per se, the triple sevens eventually making their way into the new platform, and the 737 is undergoing a major overhaul with new sim features such as walkaround, career mode features, upgraded textures, new models, a brand new cabin with a working cockpit door, enhanced gameplay features and interactivity within the cabin environment, and new sounds.Â  The 737 will also receive an update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, which aims to fix the spinning logo bug on the Universal Flight Tablet. Their upcoming 777-200ER is entering beta testing, and PMDG plans to release it for MSFS 2020 and 2024 (like the 777F). Due to the existing workload, no new features are planned for the product. â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SamScene recently released their rendition of Kunming Changshui International Airport (ZPPP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Kunming, China, with a yearly average of 42 million passengers. Built in 2009 as a replacement for Kunming Wujiaba International Airport, it quickly became one of the busiest airports in the world.Â  Its construction time was marked by tragedy, with seven construction workers dying in 2010 after an incomplete overpass collapsed, and eleven workers were injured a year later when a tunnel under construction also collapsed. Such was the cost of finishing such a large project within two years. Its main terminal is China's second-largest terminal building, with 548,300 square meters and 66 gates with jet bridges, 88 in total.Â  It's a hub for China Eastern Airlines, Hongtu Airlines, Kunming Airlines, Lucky Air, Ruili Airlines, and Sichuan Airlines.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MFSG recently released their rendition of Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (WMSA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves Greater Kuala Lumpur and has a yearly average of 949,934 passengers. Inaugurated as Subang International Airport in 1965, it was Kuala Lumpurâs main gateway until Kuala Lumpur International Airport was constructed in Sepang (1998).Â  It was designed by architects Kington Loo and C.H.R. Bailey, featuring an innovative design for the time, with an iconic floating concrete shell roof supported by mushroom-shaped columns.Â  By the late 1990s, its growth became an issue and a potential hazard, as two major fires - with casualties - had already occurred in the early 1990s. With its capacity stretched to the maximum, the government decided to build an entirely new airport elsewhere. Nowadays, the airport serves mainly as a central hub for regional and charter carriers, attracting many domestic travelers due to its proximity to the city center and overall convenient location. Itâs a hub for Firefly, and AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Berjaya Air, Scoot, and TransNusa also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground textures, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.57, requiring at least 102.21 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update for their current and future products, including a new 737 lineup update, a 777 product line (new and upcoming variants), and a 747 Classic project. The 737NG lineup has been updated to v3.00.0112. This update primarily focuses on fixing the ongoing issues with the Universal Flight Tablet, trying to reduce or wholly eliminate the eternally spinning PMDG logo bug. Minor fixes on other fronts also further refine the productâs stability. â Their main plan for the 737NG lineup was to stabilize it further, and their focus has now shifted back to their upcoming products. Extra effort will eventually be put into the revamped version for MSFS 2024, with new model upgrades, sounds, and an entirely new sound engine. â The 777-200ER is still being readied for beta testing. Its release is planned to be MSFS 2020 only at first and then a free upgrade to MSFS 2024 later. The 200LR, which is set to come right after, will follow the same order. â Regarding the upcoming 747 project, PMDG is still unsure whether the first to be released will be the -100 or the -400, as both are advancing as core development projects. Work has sped up quite significantly since they moved part of the 777 development team to the project. â They have also previewed part of the modeling work on the 747-100s cockpit, reinforcing that wear, tear, and proper labeling have not yet been added.Â  Given the 747-100s manual nature of systems management, they will implement a virtual copilot and virtual flight engineer to help manage their systems efficiently and realistically, albeit with an option to disable them if desired. PMDG claims itâs still âtoo soonâ for 747-400 cockpit previews, but the systems simulation work is well advanced. â The 747-100 previews are the first to deviate from PMDGâs usual modus operandi: instead of sharing images only when the product is nearly finished / ready for testing, they show it early in its development stage. â Their product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Robert Randazzo, PMDG's CEO, recently made an announcement post in their forum with further information on how their product line is faring with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's latest public beta update and where they now stand regarding the eventual compatibility upgrade. They built the triple 777 in MSFS 2024 using the latest SDK, and it ran in a "mostly stable fashion" with debuggers attached. The airplane operated through an entire flight, and the many issues that showed up in the process were cataloged. They will be addressed starting next week to warrant the best experience possible. That means they have removed the "blockers" that were preventing them from starting work on the compatibility upgrade, and now they can finally begin the process. â While it does run in MSFS 2024 already, it's not truly usable yet as many things don't work properly and require further adjustment. â In Randazzo's words, their optimism needle for MSFS 2024 has "moved to the mid position," and PMDG looks forward to bringing its simulation value to the new platform.Â  â PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their rendition of the Grumman TBF Avenger for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This WW2-era airplane was developed for the United States Navy and Marine Corps and eventually adopted by many air and naval aviation services worldwide. It was designed in 1940 to replace the Douglas TBD Devastator, offering an airplane that was very much in line with the technology adopted by the Axis forces at the time, in complete contrast to the Devastator, which was considered obsolete by 1939. The Avenger was designed to easily fit in aircraft carriers, with easily stowable wings that allowed way more airplanes to fit in the same carrier.Â  With a maximum speed of 447 km/h, 1456km of total range, and a service ceiling of 22,600 feet, the mighty Avenger was one of the most iconic World War 2 bombers, permanently changing naval warfare.Â  Crafted with Paul Bennetâs expertise (an aerobatic pilot who happens to own one of the last airworthy Avengers), the add-on features realistic aerodynamics, high-quality sounds, high-quality 3D modeling and texturing, and much more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $17.68, requiring at least 2.23 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>FSoares Previews Upcoming GaleÃ£o International Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSoares has recently teased the development progress on his Rio de Janeiro/GaleÃ£o International Airport (SBGL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This is the main airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a yearly average of 14.5 million passengers. It was opened in 1952 on top of a preexisting Brazilian Air Force base that was utilized by international long-haulers, which were too heavy and too large for SBRJâs (Rioâs domestic airport) 1300m runway. With the ever-increasing international demand, they finally built a passenger terminal, which was progressively expanded until 1977. A new terminal building was opened that year, and all scheduled passenger traffic was transferred there. Itâs still in use today as Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was first renovated in 1991 in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit (held in 1992), and its annual capacity increased to 7.5 million passengers. Eight years later, Terminal 2 was opened, with 24 jetways and a capacity of up to 7.5 million passengers yearly. âWith the imminence of the World Cup and the Olympic Games in 2014 and 2016, respectively, Infraero (the airportâs former manager) unveiled a $431 million upgrade and expansion plan for GaleÃ£o, including the renovation of Terminal 1, the completion of Terminal 2, and the expansion of the parking lots. The new concessionary revised the plans and included a new pier with 26 jetways, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2640 parking spaces. The $400 million sum quickly jumped to $800 million instead. AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, Azul, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Flybondi, Gol, Iberia, ITA Airways, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, KLM, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Latam Peru, Lufthansa, Paranair, Sky Airlines, TAP, United Airlines, and Voepass serve it. â There is no information on features, pricing, or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>
