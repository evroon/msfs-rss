    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight has recently published a new development update on their upcoming Fokker 70/100 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, showcasing their advancements on what allegedly pushes the boundaries of what their products can deliver. The developers take us on a test flight from Salzburg to Brussels using the latest beta version of their Fokker 100 Professional. They highlight that it is still very much a work in progress, with bugs and unfinished elements to be expected (and pointed out along the way). They start by showcasing the flight deck with its sweet mixture of CRT displays and analogue gauges from the beginning of the âglass cockpitâ era. The texturing was made using reference imagery of the real aircraft, and it also includes customizable elements such as different taxi light configurations and multiple panel and instrument configurations across the F70 and 100. â The externals have also been based on real imagery, with hand-placed rivets, screws, and panels.Â  â Just Flight has also paid special attention to the cabin, bringing a meticulous craft of the Fokker 100âs different passenger cabin configurations, with internal and external cargo and passenger door options, changing per livery configuration. The work on the cabin is mostly complete, with the only remaining things being fine-tuning the lighting and integrating specific cabin-to-cockpit interactions. â They have been focusing a lot on performance optimization, achieving FPS figures within 5% of the default 747 and 787 in MSFS 2020 with their latest F100 beta build. Just Flight reinforces that FPS figures will vary from machine to machine, scenery to scenery, and so on. They will encourage content creators to show performance figures once they are given access to the product for their reviews. The interactive checklists were included in full, housing over 300 items, 250 of which you are supposed to check before take-off, albeit most of them are only checked during the first flight of the day after a cold and dark startup. From all the tests and stuff, they have yet to complete the annunciator test, which involves a very specific, ordered illumination of all the cockpit annunciators. They captured a slow-motion video of this test from a real Fokker, allowing them to replicate it with maximum accuracy. Their FMS (Flight Management System) is custom-coded from scratch, including features such as IRS alignment (real-time and fast align), manual IRS alignment adjustment, manual flight plan entry, automatic and manual navaid tuning, navigation and performance monitoring, custom waypoint creation, and vertical navigation. They will dive deeper into the FMS in their upcoming marketing content and operations manual. The FMS on both the F70 and F100 is said to be the most complex system they have developed so far, as itâs the heart of the aircraft, interacting with the autopilot, flight model, EFIS displays, and other systems. This complexity takes time to develop and has been the most time-consuming part so far, but they consider it feature-complete as of now.Â  Based on recent testing, Just Flight claims their F70/F100 add-on is within 95% of real-world data, sometimes even reaching 100% accuracy in certain phases of the climb profile. The accuracy will continue to improve as the company further develops the product. Their Fokker 100 is already able to perform a successful autoland, although they have to be âextra vigilantâ due to the beta nature of their aircraft.Â  There is no pricing or release date information yet, but Just Flight plans to share more information soon. They are very proud of how far they have come with their most ambitious project yet in terms of sheer complexity.

    <title>Just Flight Publishes A300B4 Professional Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Just Flight recently published a new development update on their upcoming Airbus A300B4 Professional for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The update showcases the artwork on the now fully complete flight deck based on a real airframe (F-WUAB). The flight deck will be highly configurable, with multiple possible configurations toggleable via EFB or variant-dependent. While they are currently focusing on recreating the A300B4-203 variant fitted with an INS, they will also offer the option to use the UNS-1 FMS and TCAS VSI. A full list of all the possible configurations will be shared prior to the release. The passenger cabin is nearing completion, with over 200 seats and an interior design that screams 1980s. Itâs said to perfectly capture the era, except for the cigarette smoke (which they jokingly considered adding to the feature request list). A dedicated feature update on their cabin progress is coming soon. Furthermore, Just Flight can finally share external shots of the A300 for the first time in the new platform (as it was initially intended for P3D). Upon platform transition, they decided to start nearly from scratch to meet MSFSâs visual standards. â The work on the exterior modeling is said to be 95% complete, and the only things remaining are the second engine variant and the wing flex. Every rivet, screw, fastener, panel line, weathered surface, and text decal was carefully hand placed on the exterior, ensuring maximum accuracy. Itâs a massive undertaking for an airplane this big. Their development team has recently revisited the real aircraft to gather more high-resolution images, filling specific gaps in their photograph collection and allowing them to detect certain discrepancies in previously textured areas, which have since been corrected. Systems-wise, they have now integrated the systems code into their MSFS version of the aircraft, meaning it is now âaliveâ in the simulator, and their internal testing team can start evaluating it. The systems integration happened later in the development stage because most was already complete due to their original P3D development effort, meaning their first MSFS build already features a highly advanced systems suite. â The aircraftâs core systems are said to be fully custom-coded, aiming to achieve maximum fidelity. They exemplify the depth by mentioning how the A300 has 10 fuel pumps â two in each fuel tank âand the fuel pressure supplied by each pump is slightly different, varying every time you load into the aircraft, replicating what youâd see in the real aircraft. â Systems-wise, most of what is still being worked on is navigation-related, such as the autopilot and the INS. Work is progressing well, though, and they will share more information on those soon in future development updates. â There is still no release date or pricing information, but Threshold will keep you informed as development progresses.

    <title>Taimodels Releases QuÃ©bec City International Airport for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels recently released their rendition of QuÃ©bec City Jean Lesage International Airport (CYQB) for X-Plane 12. The airport serves the QuÃ©bec City metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 1.7 million passengers. It was established in 1939 as a military training facility for air observers, with the first flight only taking place two years later, on September 11, 1941. It was then known as RCAF Station LâAncienne-Lorette, and its wartime foundation laid the essential infrastructure (runways, hangars, and control tower) that would eventually be adapted for civil use. Its transition from military to civil use happened when World War 2 ended, with the Department of Transport taking over immediately. Early commercial flights connected QuÃ©bec to other major Canadian cities, fostering economic growth in the region. The 1950s and 1960s saw increased passenger numbers as air travel became more popular, requiring expansion work to accommodate the ever-growing number of people. Furthermore, the beginning of the jet age also demanded slightly longer jetways and aprons. In 2006, the administration invested over 65 million dollars in increasing the terminalâs passenger handling capacity and improving the overall quality of their services. The modernization included a terminal reconfiguration, the enlargement of waiting rooms, and the complete restructuring of the baggage handling area. The process was finished 2 years later, and the airport could now handle up to 1.4 million passengers. It was expanded again in 2011âat a cost of over 200 million dollarsâdoubling the terminalâs size. The project took 6 years to complete and also included a new runway, new taxiways, new deicing pads, and enhanced facilities. â Two years after the conclusion of the terminal expansion, further work was carried out to link the domestic and international terminals. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-quality models, custom ground markings, custom autogen around the airportâs area, performance-friendly optimization, and X-Plane 12âs weather textures. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $20.49, requiring at least 931.19 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>PMDG Publishes Development Update for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update concerning their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 and provided a concrete release date for its upcoming 777LR.Â  While PMDG was originally planning to push out a series of 777 updates a bit before FSExpo, they claim to have underestimated the amount of work required to prepare for it, ultimately deciding to hold off on pushing the updates until the dust was settled for good, in case something went wrong with the update. â They anticipate Microsoft will push out the 777 lineup update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 sometime next week (777-300ER and 777F only), bringing it up to build 116. Itâs mostly a cleanup update, with no new features per se. The same timeframe applies to the update for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 users, which will become free for 2020 version owners. â Â  The 777-200ER, on the other hand, is having issues with Microsoftâs intake process, and itâs unknown whether it will be available next week alongside the other family members.Â  â Build 166 will also be available for PMDG.com customers on Tuesday, marking the first time since the airplanes were released that there is version parity between the marketplace and their own storefront.Â  â The upcoming 777-200LR is undergoing its final testing phase and is scheduled to be released on July 15th. FSExpo has significantly delayed their progress, though, so it might be pushed to the following week. As usual, it will be made available on the website first and then in the marketplace within two weeks, assuming the intake process goes well. â Furthermore, PMDG has publicly addressed some of the questions they heard at FSExpo, where they held their booth for the first time despite being a long-term major sponsor. Along these questions, the 737NG is said to be coming âasapâ to 2024, the 737Max could be coming soon, and PMDG might work on a 787.Â  â PMDGâs product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently updated their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, bringing new features, bug fixes, immersive visual improvements, and more. Update v1.1.1 brings the long-awaited Collimated HUD, delivering accurate projection and dynamics right in your eye line, improving situational awareness in any weather. They have also addressed community feedback on the MFDs not being clickable in VR. iniBuilds says this is related to how mouse interaction checks occur per screen, which sometimes fail in VR frame updates. They are still investigating it. Furthermore, some users noted that both cursors disappear when a text box is active, whereas that does not happen IRL. It was a design choice to avoid mouse input conflicts. â The Hydraulic system logic has been fully overhauled, correcting an issue where the outer flaps wouldnât extend when the hydraulics were lost, despite the SD page showing they should. The logic has been reworked and now operates as required. â They also addressed community feedback on the ECAM memo formatting, which they claim to be accurate and based on a realistic MSN configuration and software version they had verified access to. â The visual department has seen tweaks, improving the engine blur with more transitional texture stages for a smoother animation. The metal rendering has also been enhanced, elevating the realism. 2024 users also got improved advanced weathering effects, with dents, taped areas on wings, and more. The window blinds are now visible from the outside. After months of testing, the A350 is a week away from making its debut on Xbox (MSFS 2024 only). It will include the recently released ULR variant but wonât feature the HUD yet (but itâs well underway). The 2020 version is still undergoing testing. The complete changelog for the update follows below: Systems â FIXED: GA phase stuck in engine-out condition in some casesÂ Â  FIXED: Derotation law now correctly disengages during go-aroundÂ Â

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a post published on Social Media, Just Flight has revealed a new RJ QT variant, part of an upcoming update to its RJ Professional series for MSFS 2020 and 2024.Â  In a post published on Reddit, Martyn Northall, Head of Development at Just Flight, confirmed that the new Freighter variant of the RJ will be included as part of the previously announced MSFS 2024 compatibility update. While the updateâs primary focus is to ensure full native support for MSFS 2024 and the 2024 Marketplace, it will also introduce several new features across both MSFS 2020 and 2024. Although the RJ QT Freighter never left the drawing board in real life, Just Flight has brought the design to life in MSFS, initially with four liveries: the prototype livery, FedEx, DHL, and TNT.  The update, including the freighter, will be provided free of charge to all existing RJ Professional owners, with more feature announcements expected soon.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. COWS has unveiled the DA40-NG, a new addition to its growing lineup of general aviation aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The announcement was made in a recent video, posted to the developerâs official YouTube channel. Built on the foundation of the COWS DA40-XLS, the DA40-NG brings a modernised take on Diamond Aircraftâs popular single-engine trainer. The aircraft has been designed in collaboration with real-world DA40 pilots and features a handcrafted flight model. COWS describes the result as an âexceptionally accurateâ simulation of the NGâs handling and performance, particularly well-suited for student training and procedural practice. The DA40-NG introduces several other features and enhancements. These include fully modelled circuit breakers, the Engine Indicating System (EIS), and custom cylinder physics modelling. The developer confirmed that the DA40-NG will be offered free of charge, to all existing DA40-XLS owners. While the initial release will be for MSFS 2020 and 2024, a version for X-Plane 12 is also planned at a later date. Stay tuned for more flight simulation news, right here on Threshold.

    <title>PMDG Updates 777 Lineup for MSFS 20/24 &amp; 777-200LR Releasing Later Today</title>
    <updated>2025-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has issued a new update to their 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, as mentioned in their previous development update from a few days ago. Furthermore, they have also confirmed the release of their 777-200LR for later today. Build 116 is now available for the 777-300ER, 777F, and 777-200ER via their operations center and marketplace (MSFS 2020 only for now), while the lineup should arrive in 2024's marketplace later today (or show up for people who already own the 2020 version). PMDG also clarifies that the 777 lineup for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is not exactly the same as that of the 2020 version. They have been built using the new SDK and underwent thousands of changes to ensure stability and performance. With the 777 workload easing off, PMDG will now focus on the 737NG for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. A short video of the cockpit door being operated will come soon. â The DC-6, on the other hand, is still depending on an Asobo fix, as it has suffered from an LOD issue since the advent of SU 3. â The 747's development team has gained new hands since the 777 folks are now free, meaning the process might speed up significantly from now on. Both 741 and 744 are in active development, and it's a "close horse race" to see which one will be released first. â The 777-200LR, the last of the 777 variants promised by PMDG, will be released later today. In Randazzo's words, it is the "true long-haul monster of the family." The marketplace release will follow sometime in August. â PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to roughly $78.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK-Studios has revealed Adelaide Airport as its next project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, with a release planned for next Friday. The scenery will support both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, with a new, walkable jetway feature reserved for the newer simulator and its walkaround mode.Â  Based on the announcement, the package will include a modelled terminal interior, and extensive detailing across the airport environment. Adelaide Airport is the primary airport serving Adelaide, in South Australia. Located roughly 6 kilometres west of the central business district, it is the countryâs fifth-busiest airport by passenger volume, with over 8.5 million travellers passing through in the 2024 financial year. Adelaide Airport accommodates domestic, international, and general aviation traffic, serving as a hub for Virgin Australia, a focus city for Qantas, and an operating base for Jetstar. The airport was first established in 1955, and operates over 250 flights daily to more than 30 destinations across Oceania, Asia, and North America. Adelaide is also equipped to handle large aircraft, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380. Additional details are expected in the days leading up to release.

    <title>FSLabs Updates A321ceo &amp; neo for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently issued a new experimental update to their A321ceo and ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, focusing on increasing stability, improving visual performance, and improving the handling, among other things. Update v11.0.1.309 aims to improve performance and lower VRAM usage, ensuring better headroom for users running very high resolutions or rocking cards with little VRAM to spare. Such extra headroom should warrant better stability in video memory-constrained environments, like approaching a demanding airport on top of a photogrammetric area. They have also mitigated certain CTDs that occasionally happen with very specific TCAS traffic situations and aircraft reloads. The steps taken to mitigate those should increase the overall robustness of their code, making it much more reliable. FSLabs has also worked on correcting an issue affecting the yaw behavior during the landing roll and retuning brake effectiveness based on measured stopping distances from real aircraft. These tweaks should bring more authenticity to the post-touchdown phase. â Systems were also improved, with FMGC protections added, further improvements to the NEO engine logic, ROPS behavior, and many smaller fixes.Â  â The complete changelog follows below: AOC Service:Â  â â APU: â â CIDS: â ELAC: â FMGC: â â FWC:Â  â â MCDU: â â Neo-specific: â â ROPS: â â Systems Improvements: â â Model Updates: â â The A321ceo and neo are available in their store for $69.95 each.
