    <title>PMDG Unveils Operations Center 3.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdoc3"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67536d0cda476a2b5d5c3f25_frei5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently unveiled its new Operations Center 3.0, a complete overhaul of their product management application, which has been roughly the same since 2017. The new application features a fresh design, additional diagnostic tools, in-software add-on installation, streamlined livery handling, and much more. The rollout from OC2 to OC3 will be gradual, with the 777F being the first product to transition to the new suite. People who might be interested in checking the new Operations Center are instructed to uninstall their 777F, download OC3 from here, install it, enter their PMDG credentials, and then install the 777F from there. The 777-300ER will follow shortly (within the next few days), and once it is available, the procedure is expected to be the same as the one listed above. â PMDG will also provide full documentation on operating the new Operations Center, which is said to be available âin time for the weekend.â â As they move their entire product line to OC3, installers will no longer be available once the rollout is complete, as they want people managing their product line straight from OC3. â They also hint at making a new 777 available soon, with âmore news on that on the next update.â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently released another development update regarding nearly all of its products for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Key highlights from the update include the announcement of a release window for the upcoming PMDG 777-200ER for both MSFS 2020 and 2024, as well as a rollout sequence for the product line tailored for MSFS 2024. The development team has announced that the 777-200ER will be released simultaneously for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, with the launch expected between April 16th and April 29th.

    <title>Lata Voadora Releases Campo de Marte Airport for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Lata Voadora has recently released their rendition of Campo de Marte Airport (SBMT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the first airport ever to open in Sao Paulo, Brazil.Â  It was founded in 1929 (95 years ago), and its first few years were far from glorious: it was bombarded during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932. That did not stop it from having its commercial debut a year later, with scheduled flights to Sao Carlos and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Ribeirao Preto, and Uberaba. It was Sao Paulo's main airport until the opening of Congonhas Airport in 1936, which was bigger and less flood-prone (Campo de Marte had been flooded in 1929).Â  Nowadays, it mainly handles helicopters and general aviation and still hosts a nearly hundred-year-old flying club.Â  The traffic figures are around 60,000 aircraft operations per year, a massive drop from a decade ago when they reached almost twice that amount. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a high-detail model of the passenger terminal and its interior, custom landclass buildings, custom hangars, and much more. It's available on their website for roughly $7. Due to popular demand, an MSFS 2020-compatible version is in the works and set to be released by the end of the month.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fly2High has recently released version V2 of Fresno Yosemite International Airport (KFAT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Located in Fresno, California, this airport serves both military and civilian flights, accommodating nearly 2.7 million passengers each year. The airport originally opened as a military airfield in 1942, with construction of a passenger terminal beginning in 1946. Once the terminal was completed in 1948, both Trans World Airlines and United Airlines commenced operations at the airport. In 1959, work began on a new, larger passenger terminal, which was completed and opened for use in 1962. The current air traffic control (ATC) tower was finished in 1961. The terminal underwent an expansion in 1978. After renovations in 2006 made it capable of receiving international arrivals, international service began that same year. Today, the airport serves several airlines, including Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, handling nearly 2.7 million passengers annually and just under 87,000 aircraft movements. The V2 version includes several features such as highly detailed models, high-resolution textures, and custom jetways. It also boasts a completely redesigned ground layout, new surrounding buildings, and enhancements to the main terminal when compared to the V1 version. The newly released version V2 is now available on SimMarket for approximately $18.18 and requires around 1.49 GB of disk space. For V1 owners, the V2 version is offered as a free upgrade. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

Additionally, a cargo version of the aircraft was introduced. The Boeing 727 was in production from 1962 to 1984, with a total of 1,832 units built. It has been used by various airlines worldwide across commercial, government, military, and private sectors. The aircraft became an icon thanks to its distinctive three-engine design, making it recognizable around the globe. The FlightSim Studio B727 Passenger is packed with features that enhance the flying experience. The exterior boasts detailed PBR textures, custom animations, 3D lighting, and a variety of custom liveries. The interior includes a fully equipped cockpit designed for passenger operations, a custom cabin, tailored night lighting, and an extended EFB (Electronic Flight Bag). â The flight dynamics have been developed by a real pilot, ensuring a high level of realism. System-wise, the aircraft is equipped with a comprehensive flight engineer panel, a custom SP-150 autopilot, and custom logic for the APU, GPU, generators, and more. For navigation, users can choose from five options: classic, retro, modern standard, modern realism, and futuristic. The sound package accurately replicates the JT8D-9 engine, contributing to the immersive experience.Â  â The add-on aims to be a detailed and authentic recreation of the iconic airliner. The newly released Boeing 727 - Passenger Edition requires 5 GB of storage space and is now available at Aerosoft for approximately $45.45. Owners of the Boeing 727 - Freighter Edition qualify for a 20% upgrade discount. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>Pilot Experience Sim Releases Rijeka Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Pilot Experience Sim has recently released their rendition of Rijeka Airport (LDRI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Rijeka, Croatia, with a yearly average of 164,000 passengers. The airport opened in May 1970 with a single terminal building, a single runway, and no taxiways.Â  Its layout remains largely the same, and the terminal building is still essentially the same as it was in the 1970s, albeit with minor modifications throughout the years to adapt the infrastructure to modern standards. Most of its traffic is strictly seasonal, and it is served by Air Dolomiti, Air Serbia, Croatia Airlines, Eurowings, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Trade Air, and Transavia. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, advanced LOD system, HD PBR texturing, advanced ambient occlusion, realistic runway profile, custom dynamic lighting, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $13.62, requiring at least 1.16 GB of free hard disk space to install. Click here for the MSFS 2020 version.

    <title>SLH Sim Designs Releases Grand Case-EspÃ©rance Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SLH Sim Designs has recently released their rendition of Grand Case-EspÃ©rance Airport (TFFG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport serves the collectivity of Saint Martin in the Caribbean and has a yearly average of 192,000 passengers. The airportâs origins date back to the mid-20th century, when it started as a small airstrip catering to small private planes and the occasional charter aircraft. With the flourishing of tourism in the region in the following decades, expansion work was carried out to ensure it could accommodate larger propeller-driven aircraft, facilitating air travel to and from the island. In the 1980s, the islandâs Dutch side handled most of the international traffic, while Grand Case was still a major player regionally, especially between French territories. Many upgrades occurred in the following years, including runway extensions, infrastructure modernization, and more. Eight years ago, it underwent major renovation work, including a modernized terminal building, a fire station upgrade, an extended parking apron, and a new control tower. Air Antilles, Air CaraÃ¯bes, St Barth Commuter, Trans Anguilla Airways, and West Indies Helicopters serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K texturing, animated ground equipment, custom dynamic lighting, a modeled tower interior, a custom GSX profile, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $15.34, requiring at least 767.78 MB of free hard disk space to install. Click here for the MSFS 2024 version.

    <title>Parallel 42 Releases ChasePlane for MSFS 2020</title>
    <updated>2025-04-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/p42421"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67a03568493d826e0a991328_cp1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. After nearly a month of being a Club 42 exclusive for testing and refinement purposes, Parallel 42âs ChasePlane is now available to the public. This brings their advanced physics-based camera system to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. For the unfamiliar, ChasePlane was originally released in 2016 for Microsoft Flight Simulator X, later being made compatible with Prepar3d and rapidly becoming the de facto camera application for ESP-based simulators at the time. It would only be natural for them to develop it for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 when that came about, but technical limitations have made that impossible until very recently, which is why itâs only a thing now, almost five years after the simulatorâs release.Â  The add-on features highly realistic physics-based camera behavior based on extensive research and real-world pilot footage. This warrants realistic motion that dynamically responds to the environment, embracing the flight model rather than altering it. Pilots can feel the vibration during the take-off roll, the rush of turbulence, and the fluid shifts during maneuvers. â As previously mentioned, a subscription system will no longer be required to store and share your settings in their cloud. Parallel 42 will now offer the service as a courtesy and take the costs upon themselves. â Furthermore, ChasePlane 2020 owners will be entitled to a free upgrade once the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 version is available.Â  â The add-on is available in their store for $30.00.

    <title>PMDG 777-200ER Release Window Updated</title>
    <updated>2025-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently updated the planned release window for the upcoming 777-200ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Additionally, the team has provided a more specific release window for the compatibility of the 777F and 777-300ER with MSFS 2024. A variety of other information has also been shared in the update. The release window for the PMDG 777-200ER has been updated. The original timeframe was between April 16th and April 29th, but it is now set for April 29th to May 1st, moving the release by just a few days. The team has confirmed that they will provide advance notice the day before the release.Â  â This add-on will include various engine types, such as the GE90-92 and the Rolls Royce Trent 892, along with a new generation of sound packages. At launch, only one package will be available, which will include versions of the add-on for both simulators. Compatibility for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is scheduled for the second half of May for the 777F freighter variant, followed by the 777-300ER variant within 10-14 days after the freighter release. Finally, the team has shared updates on the 2024 compatibility for its DC-6. The overhaul for compatibility is nearing completion, and everything is coming together nicely. However, there are still some minor cosmetic improvements that need to be made. We will let you know if we receive any updates. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
