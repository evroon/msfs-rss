    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft CRJ owners awaiting the launch of the CRJ v2 will have to wait a little bit longer than first anticipated, as the release has been delayed by one week. Nearly four years after its initial release, the CRJ is receiving a free v2 update, set to feature a remodelled cabin and an improved flight model. However, Aerosoft has decided to push back the update by one week to ensure the best possible experience for users at launch. Originally scheduled for March 25th, the update is now set to launch on April 1st â Benjamin from Aerosoft shared an official statement earlier today: â âWe would like to inform you that the CRJ v2 update has been delayed by one week. The new release date is April 1st. This is to ensure the best possible quality and that the update ships with as few issues as possible, including some you may have seen in the preview streams/videos this weekend. We know you all have been waiting for a long time for this update, but we would rather release a few days later than publish the update in an incomplete state. Thank you for your patience and understanding!â Stay updated with Threshold for the latest news, reviews, and more. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon</summary>

    <title>Fenix Announces A320NEO family for Microsoft Flight Simulator</title>
    <updated>2025-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fx320n"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67e6e1610162be660eaedf2e_neo-leap-hero.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix has just posted its 2025 roadmap, detailing planned updates for the current A320 CEO family, compatibility improvements for MSFS 2024, and a new NEO variant. A320 and A321 NEO Announcement The major highlight of the roadmap is the announcement of an all-new A320 and A321 NEO. After extensive research and development, Fenix has created a completely new âNEOâ standard ECAM system from the ground up, which is independent of ProSim. This advancement allows for even deeper system modeling. This is not merely an updated A320 CEO with new engines; it is a fully developed A320 NEO simulation. According to Fenix, the entire aircraft has been rewired, encompassing every sensor and generator. They have also developed a fully functional DRAIMS panel, although visuals are not yet available for display. Both the CFM LEAP engine and the Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan will be fully represented in the simulation. Additionally, the Fenix A320 NEO will be a standalone product, meaning that prior ownership of the A320 CEO family is not a requirement. Upcoming Big Fenix Update Fenix has announced that a major update for the A320 CEO family will be released in a couple of weeks. This update will include the addition of A139 sharklets, the implementation of the Weather Radar, and new landing dynamics that enhance flare and ground effect behavior. Several upgrades to the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will also be introduced, such as support for Lido charts and a improvedV-Speeds calculations. Additionally, there will be audio improvements, including a new 3D AEVC soundscape for the flight deck and a redesigned IAAE V2500 soundset. Fenix says they will provide a full changelog shortly. â For more details on the Fenix A320 NEO and A321 NEO, along with the upcoming big Fenix update, refer to Fenixâs website. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon â</summary>

Its single 900x40-meter asphalt runway and slightly high elevation make it a great challenge regardless of the size of the airplane. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom 3D models and an up-to-date ground layout. It also offers performance-friendly optimization with MSFS 2024âs new LOD system, a custom hangar with an interior, landside buildings, custom objects, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $10.79, requiring at least 349.29 MB of free hard disk space.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released a major update to X-Plane 12, which brings massive improvements to cloud rendering, lighting, environmental effects, and graphics performance. Their graphics team has been working to mitigate the famed dark cockpit issue, bringing significantly improved interior rendering quality. The light coming into the cockpit correctly follows the aircraft's contours and structural details. Furthermore, the graphics engine's exposure handling has also been improved, bringing exposure fusionâa familiar feature on most modern smartphonesâto the virtual realm of X-Plane 12. It consists of taking multiple photos at various levels of exposure and then automatically stitching them together, yielding a potentially impressive-looking result.Â  The sky brightness has also been tweaked to ensure it's more natural and doesn't burn people's retinas. Ground object brightness values have also been tweaked to ensure they are not overly bright. Their graphics engine as a whole has also undergone changes, with an upgrade to their shader compiler, which manages resources more efficiently and thus brings smoother performance figures. Texture handling has also been tweaked to ensure faster loading times and more efficient rendering. Their VRAM management method has also been tweaked, ensuring it prioritizes smaller memory requests before large ones, aiding total memory allocation. Additionally, it makes multiple attempts to allocate memory before giving up, allowing the system to free up space when needed and ultimately reduce the chances of blurry textures or slow performance overall. The cloud rendering system has also been changed, with a small radius surrounding the camera's viewport sporting high-quality clouds, nearly eliminating cloud pixelation effects around the airplane. They hint at it being a stepping stone to other cool rendering effects in the future. Last but not least, they have also changed how their light rendering system works by breaking them into tiles, yielding better performance in demanding environments such as large airports and cities. In addition, they have also made minor changes to colors, bringing more realistic color accuracy, improved sky rendering, better cloud shadows, cloud shadows on clouds, cloud-aware ambient light, and more realistic shadows overall. Detail has also been enhanced on surface textures around airports, and weather effects now also show outside of the airport's area, accumulating on main roads, as suggested by the community. â The complete changelog follows below: â Known Issues â Fixes and Enhancements General â Graphics â â Scenery â The update is currently available on the public_beta branch on Steam. Laminar customers can get the update by toggling âCheck for new betas as well as updatesâ.
