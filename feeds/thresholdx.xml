    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently made its Boeing 777F fully compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which is now available through the new Operations Center for 2020 owners. After a few days of struggling with SU 2 (as per their last development update), PMDG has finally managed to get the 777F working properly in the new simulator. It is the first of the pre-2024 777s to get compatibility.Â  Owners of the 2020 version do not need to repurchase the addon, and new purchases will grant you the two versions. Furthermore, PMDG will submit the 777F to the in-game marketplace for intake, a process that is known to take a couple of weeks. The 2020 version also got an update, as it hasnât been updated in a while, thanks to PMDG being busy with the 777-200ER. The changes include code optimizations, flight model and fly-by-wire improvements, systems updates, and bug fixes, along with new features such as the weight and balance application, and the inclusion of the SayIntentions datalink integration to both the 777-200ER and the 777F.Â  The 777-300ER is currently in testing for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and might become available later this week, but that will require further evaluation, and it is possible that it will only be ready next week. Regarding their next product, the 777L is being prepared for entry into testing, and they expect that to begin by the end of May. The addon is available at their store for $54.99.Â  If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. Navigraph recently issued an update to its flight planning tool, SimBrief, adding an advanced thunderstorm avoidance system, a new route calculation engine, and more. SimBriefâs latest versionâsubscriber-only, thoughâadded a wealth of features that, according to Navigraph, beat real-life dispatching tools even before the update.Â  With their all-new route calculator, itâs now possible to avoid specific SIGMETs along the way and plan a path around the weather. Furthermore, avoiding temporary flight restriction or ETOPS areas is also a breeze. ETOPS area avoidance makes it easier for people intending to replicate certain ferry flights on non-ETOPS-certified airplanes, providing them with a realistic and safe route.Â  In addition to these new features, you can now easily add oceanic tracks, instantly preview the route before its generation, choose specific SIDs and STARs from a dropdown list on the route calculator, and visualize them on the interactive map before ultimately picking one. â Non-subscribers have not been forgotten, and they received three new updates: a flight history overhaul, expanded aircraft options, and easier equipment editing. â The update is available right now and accessible through their website or app. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MXI Design has recently launched its version of Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Serving as Istanbul's secondary international airport, it is also the second busiest airport in Turkey, accommodating over 41 million passengers each year. The airport opened in 2001, created to accommodate the growing number of both domestic and international passengers that AtatÃ¼rk Airport could no longer handle. Construction of a new terminal began in 2008 and was completed in 2009. In 2023, the airport added a second runway, and there are plans to build new passenger terminals between the two runways. Today, the airport serves over 41 million passengers annually, facilitated by more than 240,000 aircraft movements. It operates as a hub for AJet and Pegasus Airlines, while also serving airlines such as British Airways, Flydubai, Qatar Airways, and many others. The newly released scenery features high-resolution PBR textures and modelling, interior modelling, custom jetways, an up-to-date airport layout, a custom GSX profile, and much more. MXI Design's version of Sabiha GÃ¶kÃ§en International Airport is now available on Contrail for approximately $27.28. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Verticalsim recently posted an announcement on its Facebook page concerning the cancellation of their Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (KFLL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024 due to various factors. âThis wasnât an easy decision,â they said, âespecially with much of the work already completed, but - after careful reflection - I believe itâs the right one.â The ever-rising expectations for Microsoft Flight Simulator sceneries, their lack of reference material for the airport, and shifting market demands have made the project non-viable and impractical to continue.Â  â Furthermore, their commitment to delivering high-standard scenery that meets or exceeds expectations would not be compatible with delivering KFLL, as they like to take their time to do things right and never cut corners.Â  â Verticalsim will now focus on completing Palm Beach International Airport (KPBI) and outlining a clear roadmap for 2025, âdelivering high-quality airports that I know I can bring the community the right way.â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft recently delineated its development roadmap for 2025, which so far comprises a DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (EDDL) backport to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, optimization work for Frankfurt Airport (EDDF), and a rendition of Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG). â Due to popular demand, Aerosoft has decided to backport their newly released DÃ¼sseldorf Airport to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. They appear to have found a solution to make the scenery backward compatible, even though it was built from the ground up with the new technology in mind. â All 2024 version customers will get the 2020 version free of charge, and they will ensure it also applies to Marketplace customers. Due to certain core differences, they will be provided as separate installations. â Their Mega Airport Frankfurt is undergoing heavy optimization work, with the LOD levels being revised, improved memory and CPU utilization, optimization of all 3D models and textures, and better balance between LOD and FPS. Furthermore, they will also be working on implementing Terminal 3 and updating the ground layout to reflect the latest changes. The update is going to be free for all current owners. â They have also announced a rendition of Paris Charles de Gaulle (LFPG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (and maybe 2020, if their backporting process works as intended). They promise a heavily optimized flagship scenery with a large scope, ambition, and transparent step-by-step development process. â Lastly, they announced a rendition of Stuttgart Airport (EDDS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (which may be backported depending on demand), developed by Jo Erlend and Lukas Vezyroglou. Itâs said to be already in development and will feature a highly detailed implementation focused on realism and atmosphere. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. MK Studios has just released its version of DÃ¼sseldorf Airport (EDDL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves over 19 million passengers annually, making it the fourth-busiest airport in Germany. DÃ¼sseldorf Airport, opened in 1927, did not have any international flights until two years later, in 1929. During the Second World War, the airport ceased civil aviation operations from 1939 to 1948. From 1969 to 1986, the airport underwent various upgrades, including the construction of three new terminals and an extension of the runway. As traffic to the airport grew rapidly, additional expansions were made, including the addition of a railway station and a new parking garage. Today, DÃ¼sseldorf Airport serves as a base for airlines such as Condor, Corendon Airlines, Eurowings, SunExpress, and TUI fly Deutschland, while also accommodating a variety of other airlines. The newly released scenery features a detailed rendition of the airport, high-quality 3D models and textures, fully modelled terminal interiors, an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, and more. DÃ¼sseldorf Airport, created by MK Studios, is now available for purchase from Contrail for approximately $20.43. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently published another development update concerning certain delays related to the 777-200ER and 777F's marketplace launch, the 777W update for MSFS 2024, and more. In Randazzo's own words, today's update "would be done in Captain PA's voice, if that was possible" as PMDG experiences another unexpected "turbulence" affecting the progress of their projects for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. They hit a new roadblock during their marketplace submission of the 777-200ER and the 777F by making an error in the naming convention for the 777 product line in MSFS 2024. This error is present in all of their products and will have to be addressed as it affects product placement and the relationship between the 2020 and the 2024 product versions within the marketplace's ecosystem and their own Operations Center. â Said issue must be fixed in all of their products before submitting to the marketplace again, and they are well aware of what the error is and how to fix it. However, time and testing are required to validate the changes and ensure they don't break anything.Â  â They plan to spend at least a week testing and then submit the 777-200ER, the 777F, and the 777-300ER to the marketplace one week from Friday. â The 777-300ER's compatibility update, which was supposed to come out this week, has been hit with the naming convention roadblock, preventing it from being rolled out. They anticipate it will be released almost immediately after confirming the fix works for the 777-200ER and the 777F. â Due to all the turbulence, the beta testing process for their upcoming 777-200LR has been delayed until further notice. â An update for the 777 product line has been in the works for a while. It is part of a larger fix they have been brewing, but the naming convention issue has become a priority for now.Â  â The DC-6 should be entering testing within the next few days, now that PMDG has seemingly addressed their level of detail issues with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â The 737 update project was the topic of their weekly all-hands meeting, where they mapped out the work required to bring the product into MSFS 2024. They have frozen the product scope, and the schedule is based on the remainder of the work required. Their work on the 777 has been stealing all their attention for now, but they will soon return it to the 737.

    <title>iniBuilds Updates A350 Airliner for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-05-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/350111"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/683a36256e1b9e9f81f783e6_upsy1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently issued a significant update to their A350 Airliner for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, which includes extensive overhauls and refinements across core systems, new features, and more. â Update v1.0.11 comes with new fly-by-wire features, such as the auto de-rotation system, which assists pilots during the landing phase after the main gear has touched down. The system prevents hard nosewheel touchdowns by avoiding any abrupt or exaggerated pitch changes by the pilot, helping improve landing consistency across different weather conditions and pilot landing techniques.Â  Furthermore, the update also features enhanced GPS jamming, with the satellite signals becoming degraded, blocked, or completely unavailable upon entering a jammed area, impacting navigation accuracy, ADS-B reporting, and position data for the FMS. The A350 heavily depends on GPS for efficient and precise routing, even though it also has IRS and backup navigation sources to fly the route. However, functionality will be severely limited, alerts will be triggered, and a switch to alternate navigation models may be forced. Initially, their GPS jamming system was randomized and not region-specific. In contrast, the new version integrates live data for a much more realistic experience, only jamming where GPS jamming is going on. â They calculate the regions using a system called H3 Geo to convert latitude and longitude into hex cells on a map that correlates the aircraftâs reporting of GPS data in those areas over 24 hours and dynamically updates it so the jammed regions are constantly changing based on real-world data. A throwback featureâpresent in their A300 and A310 for X-Planeâhas finally made its way to Microsoft Flight Simulator, allowing pilots to print take-off data, flight plans, metars, mailbox, and more. They used a combination of 3D animations and show/hide attachments to simulate the print process and placement of the paper on the chart clip in the cockpit.Â  For Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 pilots, the planned route API is now in working order, making it possible to send and receive the flight plan from the sim FMS and vice versa. The tool built into 2024 uses the official LIDO navigation databases and real-world submitted flight plans to provide accurate routing information. This feature will be utilized in the simâs career mode in the future. iniBuilds has also added a new condensation effect. The aircraft generates condensation on cockpit windows using the difference between outside air temperature and simulated cabin temperature, building up or dissipating over time depending on the conditions. The windshield heat status is also taken into account, just like the real aircraft. Due to sim limitations, the effect is exclusive to MSFS 2024. They have also added a wide range of new ECAM messages. Some of them were disabled in 2024, though, due to a bug in the simulator.

    <title>Taimodels Releases Singapore Changi Airport for X-Plane 12</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tmwsss"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/683f90219060370618258298_changi1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Taimodels recently released their rendition of Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for X-Plane 12. It is one of the world's busiest airports, with a yearly average of 58 million passengers. It was inaugurated 42 years ago when the Singaporean government was forced to build a new airport to cope with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel.Â  At first, their original plan was to expand Paya Lebar, the former main airport in Singapore, but the 1973 Oil crisis changed everything. By 1975, they had already decided to build a brand new airport at the eastern tip of the main island of Changi, at the Changi Air Base. After its first year of operation, the airport had already handled an average of 12.1 million passengers, which led to the construction of a second passenger terminal in the 1990s. Terminal 3 soon followed in 2008, and then Terminal 4 in 2017. Terminal 5, which is planned to be larger than all four combined, is expected to open in 2030. It's a FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, and Singapore Airlines hub. AirAsia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Hainan Airlines, IndiGo, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Swiss, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made PBR ground textures, high-detail models, SAM jetways, performance-friendly optimization, weather textures (X-Plane 12), and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $26.48, requiring at least 1.86 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SamScene3D has recently released their rendition of Qingdao Jiaodong International Airport (ZSQD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, serving Qingdao with a yearly average of 21.4 million passengers. It was built to replace Qingdaoâs former main airport, Qingdao Liuting International (same ICAO). The project was approved in 2013, and construction started in 2017. By 2020, the terminal building had already passed completion acceptance, greenlighting it for a 2021 inauguration. It features a single 478,000-square-meter terminal built to handle up to 35 million passengers a year, designed in a starfish shape with five concourses, and two 3,600-meter-long runways able to handle up to an A380. Itâs a hub for Qingdao Airlines and Shandong Airlines and a focus city for Beijing Capital Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. 9 Air, Air Busan, Air China, Air Macau, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China United, Donghai Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Jeju Air, Korean Air, Scoot, Shanghai Airlines, Spring Airlines, Tibet Airlines, West Air, and XiamenAir also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed terminals, detailed ground markings, custom jetways, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $18.09, requiring at least 3.90 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>FSLabs Releases A321ceo Update Including MSFS 2024 Compatibility</title>
    <updated>2025-06-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fsl302"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6768de3df1ae2d10ada9d7bc_labsup2.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs has recently released a new update to its A321ceo product line, available via its Public and Experimental branches on the FSL Control Center. The update adds initial compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, many system enhancements, sound upgrades, and more. Update v11.0.1.302 is their first update to feature initial compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. It makes several changes under the hood to support the new environment while also retaining compatibility with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. The new update also brings system-level improvements, including bug fixes, performance optimizations, and refinements to raise the realism bar and reliability. They were driven by extensive internal QA and feedback from their community of pilots and testers. â The sounds were also upgraded, substantially improving the soundscape around the cockpit and engines. â Furthermore, FSLabs has also added the ROPS (Runway Overrun Prevention System)ânot to be mistaken with the thing missing from some RTX 5080s and 5090sâan advanced safety feature designed by Airbus to help mitigate the risk of runway excursions during landing. It integrates two core functions: ROW (Runway Overrun Warning) and ROP (Runway Overrun Protection). The Runway Overrun Warning provides proactive in-flight alerts by continuously computing the aircraftâs predicted stopping distances on dry and wet runways, considering real-time factors such as weight, speed, configuration, wind conditions, and runway slope. If it determines the available runway length is not enough for a safe landing, it automatically issues visual and aural alerts: â The visual alert has the PFD display ârunway too short,â the navigation display indicates the predicted stopping points extending beyond the runwayâs end. The aural alert, on the other hand, triggers below 200 feet, with a repetitive ârunway too shortâ audio warning. â The alerts are in place to prompt the crew to start a go-around procedure, as a landing attempt beyond that point is deemed completely unsafe. â The ROP system takes over upon touchdown and continuously assesses the aircraftâs deceleration capability against the remaining runway length, providing immediate guidance may it detect insufficient stopping distance: â A visual alert â similar to the ROW one âdisplaying a ârunway too shortâ warning, and aural alerts issuing commands such as âbrake max braking,â âset max reverse,â and âkeep max reverseâ depending on the situation at hand, ensuring maximum deceleration efforts. â The feature was faithfully recreated to replicate Airbus logic, ensuring realism and immersion for the virtual pilot. â The Flight Performance Model has also been tweaked, changing how it responds in roll. By closely analyzing the roll momentum and inertia characteristics of the real A321 and incorporating feedback from current Airbus-rated pilots, they have fine-tuned the control laws within the ELAC (Elevator and Aileron Computer). It involved reworking gain schedules and dynamic response parameters to replicate the planeâs roll behavior more accurately across different flight phases and load conditions.  â Furthermore, the update now makes livery-specific EFB Backgrounds a possibility, no longer relying on Airline packs for that. â The complete changelog for the update follows below: Simulator Platform Air Con APU ATSU/AOC CPC Effects EFIS/FCU Engines FAC Flaps FMGC Flight Guidance/ELAC/FM LGCIU/BSCU Fault logic fixed ROPS Sounds Techlog XPDR Others â FSLabs has also briefly teased their upcoming A321neo with a single screenshot of an easyJet livery. The FSLabs A321ceo is available in their store for $69.95. If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>
