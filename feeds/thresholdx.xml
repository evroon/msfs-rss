    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aviotek Software has shared an update about the development of the Frankfurt International Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. As announced in December, the airport will be available as a free download, and the developer has been working hard to ensure that it meets the highest standards. While the community has been patiently waiting for the release, the developer has now shared further information about the project. The team has been busy adapting to the new simulator, as they are used to working with X-Plane. Although this has slowed down the pace of the project, the team has been working hard on beta testing. The beta testers have been doing an excellent job, and the team has been fixing bugs and adding new features based on their feedback.Â  They have shared several images that showcase the airport buildings, ground details, interior, and ground equipment. These images give a glimpse into the level of detail that the team has put into the project.Â  A couple of new features were added to the list, including fully functional VDGSs, fully operational jetways, more land-side vehicles, ground markings, and animations. Their libraries are also constantly being updated. â At the moment, beta testing is ongoing, and the team is working hard to ensure that the airport is as polished as possible. Once the airport is ready, it will be available as a free download for the Microsoft Flight Simulator community. We will let you know once new information is available. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â</summary>

    <title>PMDG Publishes New 737/777 Development Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777046"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6610eb3ab25734dbc3450d08_777apr1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently published another development update for Microsoft Flight Simulator, covering a new 737 lineup update to mitigate a camera issue and a couple of new 777 flight deck previews. The fixes are related to a mechanism within the 737 that handles the viewpoint when data is entered into the tablet. They found out that under certain conditions, the camera could get stuck during that process, making it seem as if the simulator is frozen, while it is, in fact, just the camera acting up. After a lot of research and replication, their tablet team engineered a fix and pushed the update right away, which is already available via the PMDG Operations Center. The update might take a while to appear on the marketplace as they are still completing their intake process on the previous build.Â  Randazzo has shared three new images of the upcoming 777-300ER flight deck, emphasizing that it does not represent the final product and is merely a work in progress.Â  It demonstrates some of the "wear and tear" they mentioned during the previous (Jokeless April Fools) development update, with high-touch areas being "polished" by oily fingertips after twelve years of heavy usage. â While the surveyed airplane is, in fact, relatively old, it was treated with care, meaning the wear isn't as accentuated as one could imagine, being mostly natural wear that inadvertently happens regardless of the nature of the usage. â They have also included dust and crumbs, which accurately represent an airplane that has been actively used for so long.Â  â PMDG also confirms it will be possible to open the cockpit door and wander around the cabin, with dynamic sounds that will change according to your position in the airplane. Nocturnal screenshots were taken but discarded because they showed slight artifacting upon compression, according to Randazzo, which also drew an interesting parallel with taking night photos of your dog and how the picture doesn't have the same personality as they do in person. "Dark scenes in MSFS are the same way. In person they look spectacular, but in still images they often look artifacted and cloudy", concluded Robert. The movable lights on the flight deck can be moved about and pointed wherever one wants, like their 737s.Â  The PMDG 737 lineup is available in theirÂ store, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $69.99. The upcoming 777-300ER's pricing and release date are yet to be revealed. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Axonos has recently released their rendition of Richmond International Airport (KRIC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Sandston, Virginia, and has a yearly average of 4.7 million passengers, making it the busiest in Central Virginia and third-busiest in the state, only behind Washington Reagan and Washington Dulles. Its history dates back to 1927 when it was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field in honor of Richard E. Byrd, brother of the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.Â  A terminal building designed by Marcellus Wright and Son was built in 1950. Expansion work, including the current passenger concourses, was conducted between 1968 and 1970. The early 2000s saw impressive growth figures, leading to a complete redesign of the terminal, which added ten gates, extra parking spaces, and a new air control tower. It also included a complete revamp of the terminal building and the construction of a central utility plant. The two-year project was concluded in 2007. It was expanded again in 2018, two years after it recorded its second-highest yearly passenger volume, with the gate count going from 22 to 30. It was concluded three years later, in 2021. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, American Eagle, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, United Airlines, and United Express serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, detailed 3D modeling, static aircraft (optional), custom jetways, custom ground clutter, realistic night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, and a custom GSX profile. â Itâs available in theirÂ storeÂ andÂ OrbxDirectÂ for $14.99 and $16.45, respectively. To install the scenery, you need at least 1.04 GB of free hard disk space. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Vref Simulations has recently announced the development and imminent release of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's set to release tomorrow (11/04) for $8.99. Further information can be found on Vref'sÂ Discord. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

Itâs a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. â Mir, the developer, emphasized that itâs still a work-in-progress project, with one of the showcased concourses (Unitedâs Concourse E) not featuring jetways yet. It was previously stated to be their most detailed work yet, sitting high above their previous projects regarding visual complexity, quality, and performance. Itâs said to be inching closer to completion, and if things go according to plan, it could be released before summer. Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations and db Scenery have recently announced the development and imminent release of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  â Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. â It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, custom landside, custom terrain mesh, custom ambient sounds, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's set to release next Thursday (18/04) for roughly $9. Refer to theÂ product pageÂ for further information.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
