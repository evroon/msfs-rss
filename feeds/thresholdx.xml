    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Axonos has recently released their rendition of Varna Airport (LBWN) for X-Plane 12, the third largest airport in Bulgaria, averaging 2 million passengers per year (pre-pandemic), serving Varna and the northeastern part of the country. It was built in the 1940s to replace Varnaâs former main airport - Tihina Airport - which was deemed too primitive for the demands of a modern city. It was enthusiastically built with the help of residents, with constant improvement work being done over the decades to keep it current, with the most notable changes being a new terminal in 1972 and a new runway in 1974. A new passenger terminal was built 11 years ago, replacing the former from the 1970s and significantly increasing passenger handling capabilities with an area of 18,000 square meters.Â  Itâs a hub for BH Air, Bulgaria Air, European Air Charter, Voyage Air, and WizzAir and is visited by Austrian, easyJet, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Volotea, and Turkish.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom night lighting, 3D vegetation, animated marshallers, an accurate ground layout, custom 3D buildings, and more. Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $18.37, requiring at least 3.91 GB of free hard disk space to install. X-Plane 11 owners might e-mail Axonos for a XP11 compatible version.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Skyline Simulations has recently released their rendition of Queen Tamar Airport (UGSM) for X-Plane 11 and 12, serving Mestia in Georgia, with a yearly average of 9,300 passengers as of 2022. Mestia Airport was part of Georgiaâs plan to increase regional tourist figures. It was built in 2010 with a GEL 8 million investment, with an architectural project that boasts a modern glassy style that contrasts with the natural surroundings and does not impact the environment. Designed and created by Jurgen Mayer-Hermann, the BBC considers the airport one of the worldâs most beautiful.Â  With a 1,158-meter runway at 1,456 meters above sea level, the range of aircraft that can fly into this airport is limited. Itâs currently only served by Vanilla Sky with their Let L-410 UVP-Es, taking passengers to Kutaisi, where passengers can connect with the rest of Europe. The scenery features a detailed rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom OSM data, PBR materials, custom 3D vegetation, custom 3D objects, high-resolution buildings, animated flags, and more. Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.65, requiring at least 4.49 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PKSIM has recently released their rendition of Melilla Airport (GEML) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Melilla, an autonomous city of Spain in North Africa with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.Â  â It was opened in 1969, and beforehand, tourists had to visit Melilla through Nador International Airport, then called Tauima Aerodrome, in Morocco (both before and after its independence).Â  Sporting a 1,433-meter-long runway, itâs mostly suitable for small regional aircraft such as the ATR, Dash 8s, etc. While theoretically, an A320/B738 and their smaller variants could land somewhat safely, the maximum fuel range (they canât fill it up entirely because the runway is very short) is not enough to reach most countries in central Europe, making it infeasible. Itâs served by Air Nostrum (Iberia Regional), the only airline connecting Melilla to the World as of 2024. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, PBR textures, GSX compatibility, and more.Â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.35, requiring at least 389.42 MB of free hard disk space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Burning Blue Design has recently previewed their work on Bembridge Airport (EGHJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, an unlicensed aerodrome in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, England.  It opened in 1920 on land owned by Bembridge Farm, becoming a licensed aerodrome one year later.  Airline services started in 1934 with Spartan Airlines, and other airlines followed suit, such as Portsmouth Southsea, Isle of Wight Aviation, and Channel Air Ferries). It ended abruptly shortly after the start of World War 2, as the airport was closed and ditches obstructed the runway to make it unusable. It reopened as soon as the war ended, but airline services never resumed. It continued as a general aviation airfield and eventually became a manufacturing ground for Britten Norman in the 60s, where they built many Islanders and Trislanders. They are still in production today, with over 1200 produced so far. â One of Britten Norman's subsidiaries, Aero Composites Ltd, began assembling Cirrus aircraft (SR20 and SR22s) in 2005. â Thereâs no information on pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Project MAX has recently released their rendition of Husein Sastranegara International Airport (WICC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the city of Bandung in Indonesia, with a yearly average of 4.3 million passengers. It was built during the Dutch colonial period and was a low-traffic airport for many decades, with less than 30 flights a day. The situation changed in the 2010s, leading to a surge that its infrastructure was not quite ready for, as the old terminal could only handle up to 750,000 passengers yearly. It eventually led to the construction of a new terminal. â Itâs being gradually replaced by Kertajati International Airport, the second largest airport by area in the country, inaugurated in 2018. It has been getting most of the domestic traffic that once landed in Sastranegara. The airport has already been partially retired as of late 2023, with turboprop flights from Susi Air being the sole exception.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, an up-to-date ground layout, PBR textures, a 3D detailed full interior, custom ground poly, detailed landside, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $9.63, requiring at least 3.38 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Flight Factor has recently shared new screenshots of their upcoming Boeing 777 V2 while also stating that they have already addressed the aircraftâs nose, but the images are from an older version. The 777 V2 will bring an entirely rebuilt rendition of their popular add-on, with an improved 3D model, textures, flight model, systems, sounds, and more. It was first introduced in the mid-90s with United Airlines. It was designed to bridge the gap between the 767 and the 747 and offer a viable replacement to trijets, which were starting to become a problem to many airlines due to their high fuel burn and ever-increasing fuel costs. Itâs known for its reliability, efficiency, comfort, and technology, with a full fly-by-wire system. Thereâs no information on the release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>
