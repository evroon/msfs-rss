    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Velocity SkyTech has recently released its rendition of Bournemouth Airport (EGHH) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport is located just 4 miles away from Bournemouth, England, and is an international airport that serves a variety of destinations, particularly warm and summer destinations. The airport first opened as a Royal Air Force station, called RAF Hurn, in 1941. In 1944, it was transferred to civil control and even served as London's international airport before the opening of Heathrow in 1946. Over the years, the airport has served a variety of airlines and destinations, growing to its current state. Last year, the airport served just over 950.000 passengers and had over 5000 aircraft movements. It is the focus city for Jet2.com, Ryanair, and TUI Airways, and also serves airlines like easyJet, offering flights to destinations including France, Greece, and Spain. The newly released Bournemouth Airport add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with several features, such as exterior and interior 3D modeling of the terminal buildings, PBR textures, performance optimization, and more. The add-on requires 375.07 MB of storage space and is currently on sale on SimMarket for approximately $13.02. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

PMDG anticipates it to be a rather quick process, and they are already evaluating the next variant after that. A major update has also been pushed to the 737 lineup, bringing the stability and performance fixes they used on the 777. It has also been pushed to the marketplace and might take around two weeks to show up. â More 737 updates are expected as they continue squashing the issues with the 777, and some of the structural changes from the Triple Seven will be back-ported, including the new navdata format, updated lateral path solving, updated autopilot roll modes, updated EFB, and more. â Last but not least, the DC-6 has been updated with the new cockpit textures. It has also been rolled out to the marketplace and might take around two weeks to become available. â PMDG concluded the weekly update thread with a brief note on the 747âs progress. It has been in development since January and is progressing nicely, with âunexpected and very exciting things planned for this product line.âÂ  â PMDGâs product line is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $77.73.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Dubrovnik RuÄer BoÅ¡koviÄ Airport (LDDU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Dubrovnik-Neretva County with a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers. The airport opened in 1962 and quickly became Yugoslaviaâs busiest. By 1987, it had already served nearly a million passengers.Â  In the 2000s, a new passenger terminal was built to replace the original from 1962, costing the administration 70 million euros. Itâs the most modern terminal in the country so far.Â  Itâs a hub for Croatia Airlines and many other European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizz Air, serve it on a seasonal basis. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, an up-to-date layout, and a custom GSX profile.Â  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.36, requiring at least 3.94 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently uploaded a teaser video and an in-depth development update of their upcoming Airbus A350 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, one of the most awaited addons for the platform so far. The short teaser video reveals some of the 3D art-focused details, along with a glimpse of the systems and sounds. Like their A300-600R, the A350 will feature fully modeled engine interiors, openable cowlings, and more. Users will be able to manage all possible maintenance options via EFB. The wear and tear system, also seen on the A300 to some extent, will be heavily improved. It will feature dynamic weathering of the aircraft, with paint peeling off the rivets, oil, and dirt streaks around potential leakage areas, dirt and grime on flaps, and more. It is said to build up as you fly the aircraft.Â  The cockpit features the same attention to detail, with PBR materials, high-resolution textures, and heavy optimization work to reduce VRAM usage without compromising visual quality.Â  Concerning the realism of the aircraft due to the apparent lack of data available, iniBuilds has said thatâcontrary to popular beliefâthereâs âquite a bitâ of data around for core systems and overall functionality. To fill all the gaps, the missing spots were covered by renting a full-motion A350 simulator for multiple hours. They have also gathered twelve dedicated A350 experts to serve as a complimentary source of information. iniBuilds claims it will be not only visually stunning but will also far exceed anything else they have produced.Â  They have also made a FAQ section with many frequently asked questions regarding their upcoming aircraft and its features.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSDG has recently released their rendition of Velana International Airport (VRMM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving MalÃ© in the Maldives with a yearly average of 4 million passengers as of 2019. The airport started as a small strip of land on the island of HulhulÃ© in the early 1960s, with a runway made of slotted steel sheets. Four years later, the government and the residents started a joint effort to build a new asphalt runway, with four districts competing for a money prize for the fastest. Over 100 volunteers enlisted, and the runway was officially opened two years later. A decade later, the tourism boom in the Maldives led to the need for an international standard airport, and they figured it would be easier to upgrade the former HulhulÃ© Airport rather than build an entirely new one from scratch. With help from the International Airports Authority of India, the new airport was completed in 1981. Expansion work was carried out for the first time in 2018, with the construction of a new runway to serve longer aircraft. Although initially only used as a taxiway, it eventually got to serve its truthful purpose with the demolition of the old Trans Maldivian Airways seaplane terminal, which was in close proximity and not within international standards, therefore blocking the runway from being utilized. The demolition and eventual greenlight for usage only happened four years after completion. A new seaplane terminal was inaugurated in 2022 to replace the demolished one. It can accommodate more than 100 planes and handle up to 300 flights per day.Â  A new passenger terminal is also under construction and set to be completed in 2025. It will be over 78,000 square meters and handle up to 7.3 million passengers a year. Itâs a hub for BeOnd, Maldivian, and Trans Maldivian Airways. Aeroflot, AirAsia, Air Astana, Air India, Air Seychelles, Austrian Airlines, Bangkok Airways, Batik Air Malaysia, Beijing Capital Airlines, British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, Condor, Discover Airlines, Edelweiss Air, Emirates, Etihad Airways, FitsAir, flydubai, flyme, Gulf Air, Hong Kong Airlines, IndiGo, ITA, Kuwait Airways, LOT, Malaysia Airlines, Manta Air, Neos, Oman Air, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, Saudia, Shirak Avia, Sichuan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, SriLankan Airlines, Thai AirAsia, Turkish Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Vistara, WizzAir, and XiamenAir also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a highly detailed seaplane base, the new terminal (still under construction in real life), interior modeling, custom night lighting, an up-to-date ground layout, and more. Itâs available on their website for roughly $21.68, requiring at least 1.20 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Updates Airbus A320 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently issued a new update to their rendition of the Airbus A320 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which includes bug fixes, improvements, and a new installer. A brand new installer has been developed to speed up their release and update process. It breaks files into smaller parts and only fetches the parts that have been altered, significantly speeding up the whole process. They have gathered comparison data, and the difference is astounding: from 2 minutes and 14 seconds total (download and installation) to 35 seconds (fastest result). They also reiterate that the figures may vary depending on hardware specs and storage speed. The sounds have also seen a rework, with binaural microphone recordings straight from a captainâs headset during a full flight, with cross-referenced ADS-B data to ensure the audio matches the correct phases of the flight. The result, balanced and adjusted accordingly, is much closer to the real thing. They have also improved the over- and behind-wing experience with new N1 bearing recordings, airflow, N2, and behind-intake buzzsaw on the CFM56s. They also have done further sound balancing on IAEs, with new airflow recordings, buzzsaw improvements, and a new window vibration/rattle on both at high power settings. The atmospheric sound model also received its fair share of refinement. Different ambient conditions influence the engine sounds, as demonstrated in the video below, which showcases the difference between a takeoff in the cold and dry versus hot and humid. Last but not least, still regarding sound improvements, Fenix added two hydraulic pump options: Vickers and Parker, as per the real thing (it can be fitted with either), and their subtly different sounds. The systems and flight model were not massively improved due to their strong focus on the upcoming expansion (A319 and A321). Still, they have improved the ADIRU wind simulation, so the airplane gathers wind data through its sensors rather than fetching it through the simulator. The fly-by-wire was made slightly smoother in pitch while retaining precision, and the ground-to-air blend was made creamier. The full changelog follows below: â The Fenix A320 is available on their website for roughly $64.33. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â Â  â</summary>
