    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flightbeam Studios has recently shared new images of their upcoming San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing the progress on the terminals, ground texturing, and custom jetways. San Francisco International is the second-busiest airport in California, with a yearly average of 57 million passengers, only behind Los Angeles International.  Itâs a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. â Mir, the developer, emphasized that itâs still a work-in-progress project, with one of the showcased concourses (Unitedâs Concourse E) not featuring jetways yet. It was previously stated to be their most detailed work yet, sitting high above their previous projects regarding visual complexity, quality, and performance. Itâs said to be inching closer to completion, and if things go according to plan, it could be released before summer. Threshold will keep you informed on the matter! â</summary>

    <title>GearDown Simulations &amp; db Scenery Announce Guarulhos International Airport for MSFS</title>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6618c9dead3989329b5a7ebe_gdru1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations and db Scenery have recently announced the development and imminent release of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.Â  â Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.Â  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. â It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery will feature an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, custom landside, custom terrain mesh, custom ambient sounds, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's set to release next Thursday (18/04) for roughly $9. Refer to theÂ product pageÂ for further information.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SimulaciÃ³n Extrema has recently released their version of MÃ©rida International Airport (MMMD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving the Mexican city of MÃ©rida, the airport has a yearly average of around 3.67 million passengers. The airport is located 3.1 miles (5 km) southwest of the city center of MÃ©rida, lying in the famous State of YucatÃ¡n. MÃ©rida International Airport was established in 1929, when Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n began flying the Ford Trimotor to and from the airport. In 1964, the airport was acquired by the Mexican government and underwent a massive reconstruction in 1968. American Airlines began flying to MÃ©rida in the 1960s, which helped grow the airport further. In the 1990s, the airport became part of the Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste. This group operates several airports. Throughout the years, MÃ©rida International Airport has had numerous passenger and cargo operations with airlines such as AeromÃ©xico, American Airlines, United Airlines, Viva Aerobus, and many more. As a result, passengers can fly to many cities such as Mexico City, Miami, Atlanta, Havana, and many more. The new scenery features custom jetways, custom taxiway and runway textures, PBR textures, hand-modeled exterior and interior, and much more. The add-on requires 957.05MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.85. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

From 1945 to 1964, the airport served as the Naval Aviation School, and in 1970, the Naval Command headquarters moved to the airport. It wasn't until 1968 that the airport started handling civil and commercial traffic. Today, AerolÃ­neas Argentinas connects the airport to multiple domestic destinations like Buenos Aires, Mar del Plata, and Trelew. The BahÃ­a Blanca Airport scenery package boasts several features, including custom jetways, custom taxiway and runway textures, PBR textures, hand-modeled exterior and interior, accurate rendition of the Comandante Espora Air Naval Base, and much more. The add-on requires 875.96MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.85. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Orbx has recently released the PNG Highland Bush Strips Pack 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a package with seven challenging airstrips in Papua New Guinea, the toughest country in the world to be a bush pilot. Bush airstrips in Papua New Guinea are generally the only gateway to certain remote villages, meaning itâs vital to their existence and the only way to bring supplies in. The weather is often harsh, the runways are often short and hand-carved, and the challenge is unparalleled. The new pack adds on to the previously released pack (back in October 2023), adding seven new destinations (Sapmanga, Isan, Tep Tep, Bambu, Nankina, Nahu, and Guhu), with well over 100 unique models, PBR texturing, LOD optimization for optimal performance, realistic terrain profiles, vegetation adjustments to facilitate STOL operations, and more. Itâs available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $12.32, requiring at least 2.79 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FLYT Simulations has recently previewed the development progress on their rendition of Comandante Ariston Pessoa Regional Airport (SBJE), serving Jijoca de Jericoacoara, Brazil, with a yearly average of 102,000 passengers as of 2023. Funded by a government plan to develop regional aviation in Brazil, construction work began in 2011 and concluded three years later. The inauguration, though, only happened in 2017 after a series of organizational mishaps.  The passenger terminal, designed by Francisco Antonio Laprovitera Teixeira, consists of a single block with departure and arrivals, food kiosks, bathrooms on each extremity, andânot manyâcheck-in desks.  Its 2200m runway is long enough to accommodate an Airbus A320 and its Boeing counterpart, the 737-800.  Itâs served by Azul (Belo Horizonte), Azul Conecta (Fortaleza, ParnaÃ­ba), Gol Transportes AÃ©reos (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos), and LATAM Brasil (SÃ£o Paulo - Guarulhos). â While there is no information on features, the images showcase special attention to the terminalâs interior. Previously revealed images from earlier this year also point to custom ground textures and realistic clutter. â Itâs said to be releasing in the next few weeks, exclusively on the MSFS Marketplace.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon recently released their version of Salerno Costa d'Amalfi Airport (LIRI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Italian city of Salerno and has been closed for several years due to renovations and upgrades. It is scheduled to reopen in July 2024. The new scenery package from Barelli MSFS Addon features both a 2024 and a proposed 2026 version of Salerno Airport. The Salerno airport was established in 1926 by Italy's Air Force, primarily for flight training. Over the years, the airport underwent several upgrades. However, it wasn't until 2007 that it received check-in desks, boarding areas, luggage belts, and waiting rooms, allowing it to accommodate commercial traffic. In 2011, a project for the airport's further extension and new infrastructure was revealed, leading to its closure in 2016 for construction purposes. After a lengthy period of closure, the airport is set to reopen in July 2024. Airlines such as easyJet and Volotea have already planned numerous domestic and international destinations from Salerno. However, the airport will continue its construction until its completion in 2026. The new scenery package includes custom terminals, custom airport buildings, custom lighting, and much more. It offers two renditions of the airport, the current 2024 version, and the proposed 2026 version. Barelli MSFS Addon has stated that once the final changes for the airport are available, the scenery package will be updated accordingly. The add-on requires 227.11MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.86. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just a week after the v2 update for the 146 Professional, Just Flight published a development update for their upcoming RJ Professional, which is based on the Avro RJ, a modernized variant of BAe 146. â Thanks to similarities between 146 and RJ, the passenger cabins from 146 have been integrated into RJ and will include all cabin features that were present in the 146 Professional v2 update, along with small changes to reflect the difference in the RJ. One of the main differences between the two aircraft is the Flight Attendant panel, which has a switch for cabin lighting, as well as some different panels. Unfortunately, as of the posting of the development update, no screenshots of the cabin have been previewed. â Significant progress has been made in the RJ cockpit. Most of the systems that were semi-automated in 146 are now fully automated in RJ, such as the pressurization system. Even though the system couldâve been ported from 146, JF has decided to recode the whole system from the ground up.Â  â Along with the pressurization system, the development team has simulated the FADEC system as well. This system allowed all RJs to be fitted with auto-throttle, and also increased engine reliability and lowered fuel consumption. The modern GNLU-910A FMS will be integrated into RJ systems and will allow the implementation of LNAV and VNAV autopilot modes.Â  â Another area of development that is not being left out is liveries. Currently, over 30 high-quality liveries have been made, ranging from the very first operators of Avro RJ, all the way to present operators.Â  â Even though they have not shared any screenshots of the interior, lots of work has been done behind the scenes. Unfortunately, the release date is still not known, but, as always, Threshold will keep you updated with the progress of RJ Professional! â Stay tuned for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently released a new update to their A320 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, along with a quick delineation of their next steps, pricing for the upcoming expansion, and more. The newly released V2.0.0.407 brings angle of attack tweaks in flight control law, external engine performance optimizations, CTD mitigations, GSX integration issues, sound optimizations and fixes, a rework on the LOD (level of detail) system to fix FPS loss, many EFB fixes and improvements, and more. The complete changelog follows below: They are also happy to report that the A319/A321 package development is progressing nicely, and beta testing should begin âvery soon.â In celebratory fashion, the A320 is currently on sale for roughly $49.92 (the same price as the upcoming expansion) until 2200Z on Wednesday (17/04).Â  The aforementioned A320 base package includes the CFM and IAE variants of the Airbus A320 and their sharklet counterparts, albeit later in the year (after the release of the A319/A321 expansion). The upcoming expansion will, therefore, include the A319 and A321 with CFM and IAE engines and wingtip fences only at first, with sharklets to follow later in the year. It represents an average of $9.36 per variant! Based on customer feedback, their short-term plans include changes to the flare behavior and ground effect. While they wonât make significant alterations to keep the consistency at bay, they have identified areas where gentle adjustments can be made, especially regarding ground effect. Although satisfied with the lift/cushion effect, they feel like the drag addictive could be slightly increased, helping the aircraft âsettleâ on the runway a bit better.Â  While Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs lift and drag of the ground effect are intrinsically tied to one another, the developers found a way around it with a custom solution that would allow granular control over the drag properties when under said ground effect.Â  Complaints about controlling the aircraft when on the ground were also listened to and the ground friction modeling was re-tuned in accordance with SU15 and its new ground friction model.Â  Both ground effect and ground modeling tweaks are expected to be rolled out as soon as possible, with the upcoming expansion not being an obstacle whatsoever.Â  The add-on is available in theirÂ storeÂ for roughly $49.99 (until 17.04), under a 20% discount.

    <title>NZA Simulations Releases NZTG - Tauranga Region for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/661d23807ac725925069ce22_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. NZA Simulations recently launched a new scenery package called NZTG - Tauranga Region for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The package includes Tauranga Airport (NZTG) as well as three other locations: Waihi Beach Aerodrome (NZWV), Motiti Island Airport (NZOI), and Tauranga Hospital Heliport (NZJA). Tauranga Airport is situated in Tauranga, New Zealand, and is the main airport serving the region, with an average of approximately 376,000 passengers in 2022. In 1935, the Tauranga Aero Club leased some land to establish an aerodrome in the Tauranga area. Due to growing demand, a permanent facility was required, and the aerodrome was converted into Tauranga Airport. The airport opened in 1939, but shortly after, the Royal New Zealand Air Force took control of it because of World War II. During this period, the airport underwent some upgrades, including runway extension and new hangars. In 1945, the airport was returned to the Tauranga Aero Club, and the first passenger flights were introduced the following year. The airport underwent several upgrades over the years, and today, it is the 8th busiest airport in New Zealand. Air New Zealand, Barrier Air, and Sunair are some of the airlines that operate from the airport, providing passengers with a broad range of destinations. The new scenery package features a precise depiction of Tauranga Airport (NZTG), Waihi Beach Aerodrome (NZWV), Motiti Island Airport (NZOI), and Tauranga Hospital Heliport (NZJA). The package also comes with custom 3D modeled objects, 3D interiors, animations, custom lighting, and numerous other features. The add-on requires approximately 1.58GB of storage space and is available on NZA Simulations' website for around $20.20. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Aerosoft Releases Lukla Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released a new add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, called Aerosoft Mt. Everest Airport Vol. 1 - Lukla. The add-on includes the renowned Tenzing-Hillary Airport (VNLK), also known as Lukla Airport. The airport of Lukla has gained notoriety for its challenging and risky approach and takeoff procedures. It is located in Nepal, surrounded by mountains, and has a runway length of only 1729 ft (527 m). Despite its short runway, the airport can still accommodate up to 150,000 passengers annually. Lukla Airport was constructed in 1964, after the original plan to build the airport on flat farmland was abandoned due to local farmers' unwillingness to give up their land. Instead, the airport was built at its current location, and Sir Edmund Hillary oversaw the construction process. He purchased the land from local Sherpas, but was dissatisfied with the soil resistance of the runway. It wasn't until 2001 that the runway was paved. In 2008, the airport was renamed Tenzing-Hillary Airport in honor of Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. Today, the airport is operated by several airlines, providing flights from destinations such as Kathmandu, Manthali, and Phaplu, and has become increasingly well-known. The newly released rendition of Lukla Airport features detailed 3D terrain model of Lukla Airport, high-resolution photorealistic textures, Lukla Helipad, detailed terminal building with interior, animated people and animals, realistic night lighting, and more. The add-on requires approximately 4GB of storage space and is available on Aerosoft for around $8.90. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
