    <title>SoFly Confirms December Release For AeroTone Audio Enhancer</title>
    <updated>2025-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/sflyat"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/693a07a04524e948041eb647_aerotone.co_-_Google_Chrome_19-11-2025-22_15_30_b05508c2-0898-49fc-b64a-375a621c6fc5.png"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. SoFly has confirmed that AeroTone, its new audio enhancement add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, will release on Dec. 17, 2025.Â  The product was previously announced under the working title Aircraft Sound Enhancer, and has since been renamed and expanded. AeroTone is built around a custom in-sim panel that runs entirely inside the simulator, with no need for external tools. From this panel, users can adjust individual sound layers, fine-tune levels, and save profiles per aircraft.Â  Settings are stored and recalled from within the cockpit, so you can switch between aircraft and keep separate sound setups without additional configuration. On the audio side, SoFly has partnered with Echo19 to create a high-quality soundscape that reacts to the aircraft and environment. Ground roll, vibration, airframe stress, turbulence, touchdown effects, and avionics noise are all driven by in-sim conditions, with separate treatments for cockpit and cabin views.Â  AeroTone is compatible with every aircraft and vehicle by default, while more than 120 official profiles will ship at launch for popular types. Simmers can also create their own profiles, reset back to an official or community preset if needed, and import community-created configurations.Â  The intention, according to SoFly, is to make AeroTone easy to use for beginners, while still offering enough depth for those who wish to customise every detail. AeroTone also includes regionalised ATC ambience, with many hours of prerecorded chatter, that adapts to your current location and flight phase.Â  Different accent sets cover regions such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, with distinct sets for ground operations and en-route traffic. AeroTone will be available for PC at launch, supporting both MSFS 2020 and MSFS 2024, with game controller support included. SoFly plans to bring the add-on to Xbox and PlayStation 5 via the in-sim Marketplace after the initial release. Pricing has not yet been announced. Learn more here.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. In a recent Discord post, Skyward Simulations has shared some screenshots and a feature list for their upcoming Citation C680 Sovereign+ for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. This will be the team's second project and represents a huge leap for the team. Their first project was the relatively simple Diamond DA-50RG. A far cry from a Citation in both speed and complexity. The team notes how much progress has been made on the new project and promises that a release date announcement is coming soon. So far, the new plane has been confirmed to feature a fully simulated electrical system, anti-ice system, SimBrief integration, checklists, FADEC, autothrottle, EFB, fully modeled interior, G5000 avionics, and much more.Â Â  With their ambitions set so high, hopefully, Skyward Simulations can deliver this beautiful bird to a virtual hangar near you soon. You can check out the full feature list and more on their Discord.Â  Their DA-50RG can be found on the Microsoft Flight Simulator Marketplace and Orbx. It was originally released for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, so it lacks some fidelity on the walkaround, but it still represents an enjoyable experience that will help set your expectations for what is to come. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. BeyondATC has released a YouTube video giving, the community insight into the programâs current status and future.Â  After the team spent 10 months stabilising the program's core features, they announced they are ready to move on to developing visual flight rules (VFR). The team plans to roll out VFR in phases, with coverage expanding over time.  In phase one, VFR coverage will be provided for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with a focus on circuit entry and exit. Phase two will introduce different types of airspace, while phase three will allow the completion of full VFR flights. The team notes that it will take time to roll out these features. However, if the developersâ plans go as expected, simmers will soon have new ways to integrate air traffic control into their flying experience.Â  To learn more about BeyondATC, you can check out their official website.

The profile also exposes controls for ground services, aircraft performance information, ATIS, and various cockpit and cabin features.  It is designed to take advantage of newer MSFS 2024 features, including walkaround and external interaction points. Both 15 and 32 key layouts are included, with support for the Elgato Stream Deck XL, Stream Deck MK.2, Stream Deck Mobile on iOS and Android, and the Corsair Xeneon Edge.Â  The iFly 737 Max 8 Stream Deck profile is available now for $33 from the Flight Panels store and selected third-party marketplaces.

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. The Flight Sim Awards are coming back for 2026! The first award ceremony we held earlier this year was met with great enthusiasm from both developers and community members. All the feedback and lessons from last year have been taken into account, and efforts have been made to ensure that the Flight Sim Awards 2026 is bigger, better, and ready to celebrate in a meaningful way. The organizing committee, comprising FSElite, Cruiselevel, and Threshold, has been working diligently on the next ceremony, reviewing the structure to ensure a fair, transparent, and meaningful selection process. The awards continue to honour excellence and long-term contributions within the flight simulation community, recognizing achievements in development, creativity, and community engagement. In the updated structure, we aimed to create space for developers and creators who may not have fit naturally into previous categories. Each category has been reviewed to ensure relevance, clarity, and a balanced representation of the many areas that advance our hobby. We also added categories to highlight community contributions, which are often overlooked. All entries are evaluated according to shared principles: Each category represents a part of what makes flight simulation thrive: creativity, precision, and the human dedication behind the virtual skies. More information on the nomination process and jury panel will follow shortly. The next Flight Sim Awards ceremony will once again take place during the Captainâs Dinner at Flight Sim Weekend on Friday, March 20th, 2026. You can find more information on our website and tickets to FlightSimWeekend and the Captains Dinner here. Join the Flight Sim Awards Discord and be a part of the Awards community</summary>

    <title>Parallel 42 Releases Typical Weather for MSFS 2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Parallel 42 has recently released their first weather-related add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, named âTypical Weather,â due to the fact that it does not use live weather data but a historical compilation of weather figures from around the world, providing a typical METAR for that specific period of the year. Typical Weather is âan intelligent, location-aware weather engine that adapts to where and when you flyâ, bringing a completely new approach to weather in simulators, delivering conditions that make sense for the place you are flying in without the unpredictability of live weather. Parallel 42 argues that live weather is âinconsistentâ, allowing for clear sunny days in the middle of winter, contrary to the expectation of what you would expect from a determined location. Typical Weather prevents that from happening by using historical weather data from over 9,000 weather stations and nearly 20 million sample points, always providing what would be rather usual throughout the year. The plugin also allows the user to choose from atypical conditions if desired, with options ranging from fair to hazy, foggy, windy, precipitating, stormy, or IFR, all based on the region being flown in. Furthermore, the apps panel will also provide a detailed METAR, with wind and gust visualization, and the possibility to synchronize everything for multiplayer sessions, in addition to being either static or dynamic. â Itâs available in their store for $20.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research has recently released a hotfix for X-Plane 12 to address a few minor issues found in their latest release.Â  The current iteration of X-Plane has been supported since December 2022. Since that time, many patches have been released, to fix bugs and expand on features.Â  According to this round of patch notes, X-Plane 12.3.3 addresses an issue with the latest version of Nvidia's Graphics Driver, as well as addressing an instancing objects issue within the software development kit.  Mac users are also told to check that they have the latest installer version, 5.2.1. Recent updates have focused on air traffic control, weather, cloud visuals, flight lessons, and general visual enhancements.  According to Laminar Researchâs roadmap, version 12.4 will be a âC-Checkâ, focusing on systems and the user experience. You can get the update by simply running X-Plane 12 and following the update instructions. If you have yet to try X-Plane 12, you can try a free demo here.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has published another development update regarding their upcoming 737-800 upgrade for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which will feature a comprehensive overhaul, including a new cabin, new cockpit textures, new sounds, and more. â The developers argue that their original 738 is a really old product in software terms (3.5 years old), and they had not yet fully understood the simulatorâs potential at the time of release. 2024 has given them the opportunity to dive deeper into the potential offered by the new platform and bring it up to modern standards. â Itâs said to be a significant overhaul of the 737 product line, wholly capitalizing on the simâs capabilities: a new cockpit with new materials, lidar scanned models, new lighting, new surface textures; a new cabin, new interactable items around the airplane, customized door logic, operable cockpit windows, and a new 3D sound-set built by a professional sound engineering team whose lead sound engineer is also a type-rated 737 captain. â While there are still some cleanup details to finish around the external area, PMDG hopes to release it on Thursday (18/12), just before Christmas, so people can enjoy their Christmas break flying the brand-new product in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. â They have also listed a few FAQ such as price (in line with previous products), discount for previous owners (previous owners will in fact get a discount, both on marketplace and pmdg.com), discount across purchase venues (if you bought it on marketplace, it will be only applicable to marketplace, and so on), and the potential release date for the other 737s (-600 and -900 in January, and -700 in February). âIf you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Microsoft has ported its latest version of its landmark simulator, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, onto the PlayStation 5.Â  The full release of the sim for PS5 follows a phased rollout that included early access for those who pre-ordered the Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, or Aviator editions.Â  While the game experience remains the same for PS5 users, Microsoft has noted that access to the in-game marketplace will require a separate app.Â  As a consequence, purchases made in the in-sim marketplace wonât transfer over from other platforms. However, the port does offer more people the chance to take to the virtual skies.Â  Veterans of the PC launch will no doubt take note of Microsoftâs new phased release approach. This approach should hopefully negate the problems faced by simmers just over a year ago, when Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launched on PC and Xbox, leading to vastly increased wait times.Â Â  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 can be purchased from the PlayStation Store on your console. Where do you think the sim will be ported to next? Mac? The Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know!Â Â  For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. In a recent post, VATSIM confirmed that, starting January 1st, 2026, they will require all new users to be at least 16 years of age.  The online air traffic control network claims it is making this change as part of its ongoing work to ensure a safe and welcoming environment for all members.Â All current users aged 13 to 15 will be exempted from this policy.Â  While some see the recent changes as a necessary step to maintain the network's safety and security, many others feel that VATSIMâs policy shifts could deter membership growth.Â  How do you feel about the way VATSIM is being run? Does this make you more likely to sign up for VATSIM or maintain your current membership? Or is the organisation becoming a little too restrictive? â Let us know! â For all the latest news and updates, stay tuned on Threshold!
