    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSDG has recently released their rendition of Teruel Airport (LETL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a maintenance and storage airport in Teruel, Spain, inaugurated 11 years ago. Originally a military airbase, the airport was repurposed into a maintenance/storage facility due to its dry climate, which is highly suitable for long-term aircraft storage. It played a considerable role during the pandemic, storing over 100 airplanes from multiple carriers. Given the lack of passenger traffic, the airport features only a basic terminal and has no infrastructure for passenger handling. It also houses the PLD Space Propulsion test facility, where they conduct rocket engine tests. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, dozens of parked aircraft, performance-friendly optimization, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $13.54, requiring at least 775.67 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Pilot Experience Sim Releases Bordeaux-MÃ©rignac Airport V2 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pesbod"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66407a23a9e61deacd2d9eb1_bordeaux1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Pilot Experience Sim has recently released the second version of their Bordeaux-MÃ©rignac Airport (LFBD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the commune of MÃ©rignac with a yearly average of 7.7 million passengers. It was built in 1910 to host a major Aviation Week event, making it one of the oldest French airports.Â  In the early 1930s, the French Air Force heavily upgraded the airport by constructing many new hangars, surface improvements, and more. A passenger terminal was built in 1935, officially going from an air station to an airport.Â  With World War 2 looming, the government invested more money in transforming Bordeaux into a proper military base, adding two runways, which were completed in 1939 and 1940, respectively. MÃ©rignacâs brand-new runways were quite attractive to the Germans during their invasion of France. The structure was mostly new, and the runways were long and hard, ideal for their operations. They rushed to complete the work on runway two, and soon enough, it became one of their air bases. It was heavily bombed in 1944, and the German soldiers blew up the last remaining buildings before leaving the area.Â  Repairing was carried out right after the war, between 1945 and 1947. Prisoners of war built a terminal, a restaurant, offices, and a control tower. They were meant to be temporary and made of wood, but an actual replacement only happened twelve years later. In 1959, a new terminal was inaugurated, designed by Raymond Mothe. It was expanded several times, and its capacity maxed out at 2 million passengers annually. Further expansion occurred in the early 2000s, bringing its passenger handling capabilities to over 6 million a year. Itâs a focus city for easyJet, Ryanair, and Volotea. Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Transavia, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling also serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, performance-friendly optimization, 3D people, custom aerial imagery, PBR texturing, custom static aircraft, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.40, requiring at least 4.58 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Yamagata Airport (RJSC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Yamagata in Japan and has a yearly average of 223,000 passengers. â It was opened by the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War 2 and briefly used by the United States military after the war. Later, it was utilized by the Japanese Self-Defense Force as a training facility.Â  It was turned to civilian control in mid-1964 as a third-class regional airport. Eight years later, the runway was extended to 1,500 meters, leading to a reclassification to Class II in 1979. A new - and final - extension happened in 1981, followed by the construction of a new terminal building in 1984. International charter services started in 1981, taking full advantage of the newly expanded runway. Destinations included Finland, Hungary, New Zealand, and even Mexico. The airport's traffic peak was in 1991, followed by a rapid decline in 1992 due to the inauguration of the Yamagata Shinkansen. While the airport saw almost 500,000 passengers in 1991, the figures were down to 50,000 in 2002.Â  Fuji Dream Airlines (Nagoya, Sapporo), J-Air (Osaka), and Japan Airlines (Tokyo) currently serve it.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom ground-poly, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.86, requiring at least 29.20 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Trident recently released its rendition of the AgustaWestland AW109 for X-Plane 11 and 12. This multi-purpose helicopter is used in a variety of roles, both military and civil. Its development began in the late 1960s, with the first prototype making its maiden flight in 1971. The official FAA certification in 1975 followed, and it was officially introduced in 1976.Â  Originally designed and manufactured by Agusta as A109, it was the first all-Italian helicopter to be mass-produced. An eventual merger of Agusta and Westland Helicopters from Britain led to a rebranding as AW109. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206C engines, the AW109 can cruise at 285 km/h and has a maximum range of 932 km.Â  The add-on features an accurate rendition of the popular helicopter, with a high-quality 3D model, fully animated cockpit elements, a fully digital instrument panel, a functional circuit breaker panel, a custom FADEC with fully automated engine start sequence, realistic performance across all envelopes (tested by real-life pilots), and more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently released their rendition of Kristiansund Airport (ENKB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Kristiansund in Norway and has a yearly average of 314,000 passengers. The airport was inaugurated in mid-1970 after almost two years of construction, costing the government 31 million NOK. There was a competition to serve the new airport from the start: Both Braathens SAFE and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) wanted the lucrative route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Both were granted the route on a temporary basis.Â  The construction and eventual inauguration of Molde airport in 1972âwhich kicked in right after Kristiansund Kvernberget's inaugurationâled to a massive drop in traffic figures, given that it single-handedly cut half the region's catchment area. For comparison, Kristiansund averaged 88,246 passengers a year during its second year of operation, and it took another fourteen years to match that figure again after Molde Airport's inauguration. It underwent a massive overhaul in 2010, funded by Avinor, including a runway expansion, a larger car parking lot, and the construction of a larger terminal.Â  It's currently served by Braathens Regional Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, detailed landside recreation, custom elevation for the entire island, custom night lighting, an up-to-date airport layout, a custom GSX profile, and more. â It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $13.74, requiring at least 1.90 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6643d498922cd349104b90c0_xpl1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released the first public beta of X-Plane 12's long-awaited 12.1.0 update. This update introduces improved anti-aliasing, new particle effects, lighting improvements, and more. With a strong focus on visual quality improvements, X-Plane 12.1.0's first public beta brings a glimpse into the heavy strides made into improving the anti-aliasing system, depth of field, shadows, lighting, particle effects, water, and autogen. Below is a list of the key takeaways from the visual improvements at hand:Â  Anti-aliasing (AA):Â Improved quality with better scene handling and coverage for alpha-tested surfaces (those with transparency). Depth of Field:Â More control with a setting for Real Camera Shake (RCAS) and a notification when textures are reduced due to memory limitations. Shadows:Â Smoother shadows overall, cloud shadows on water, and faster rendering times. Lightning:Â This version features more realistic visuals with subtle color adjustments, distance variations, and bolt thickness changes. Sound effects have also been improved for a more immersive experience. Particle Effects:Â The new system allows for particles on ground contact, easier editing with copy/paste, and datarefs for better control. Pre-built effects include jet engine afterburners (JATO), water bombing, ground scrapes, and rotor wash from helicopters. Aircraft configuration files (ACFs) let you disable these effects if desired. Water:Â Fixed water clarity issues, with color and transparency depending on location. Cloud shadows are now visible on water surfaces. Compatibility note: existing X-Plane 11 water scenery packs may not work perfectly due to differences in water rendering and might require updates from the creators. Autogen:Â Enhanced visuals for high-rise buildings in European cities and improved parking aircraft placement at airports, prioritizing larger planes for bigger spots. The update also enhances the G1000 navigation system, including an accurate startup splash screen, a NAV page, a stormscope, datalink weather support, Terrain, aÂ WPT page, anÂ AUX page, and new datarefs.Â  It also includes two additions to the supported flap systems, allowing the accurate simulation of manual flap controls such as the one in the Piper PA-28, with precise and gradual adjustments, and the dial-a-flap system, which is present in some McDonnell-Douglas aircraft. The complete feature list and changelog can be foundÂ here, along with further information. Â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
