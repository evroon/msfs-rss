    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Jo Erlend has recently submitted anotherÂ batch of screenshotsÂ showcasing the progress on the Oslo Gardermoen Airport (ENGM) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the busiest airport in Norway with 30 million passengers yearly.Â  â Oslo Gardermoen is the main airport serving Oslo. It is located approximately 47 kilometers northeast of the city center and opened in 1998 to replace the outdated Fornebu Airport, which had been operating since 1939. It was built to modernize and expand Norwayâs airport infrastructure and improve accessibility to the capital city, quickly becoming the Main hub for domestic and international travel in the Country.Â  â The new previews were taken while Jo adjusted the AI traffic logic, which could denote its closeness to rollout. However, he says thereâs still some back and forth between him and his initial group of testers with feedback being gathered, and itâs soon to reach a larger group of testers for that final bug squashing.Â  â Thereâs no information on the pricing or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you updated!</summary>

    <title>Fenix Simulations Releases A320 V2 Block 2 Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fsra2b"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65dfafa4c3392bf1dcef290a_b21.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently rolled out the V2 Block 2 Update for their Airbus A320 add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, adding the IAE engine variant, a new external model, a vast list of bug fixes and improvements, and more. As previously mentioned during ourÂ coverage of their feature review video, the update brings a fully custom engine model, meaning it will no longer produce inadequate performance figures and fuel burn. Unlike the original plan, which was to release IAEs with the custom engine model and then later start the process on CFMs, Fenix has decided to do both simultaneously, bringing both up to the same standard at the cost of a slight delay. The update also brings a highly customizable PA system per ICAO/IATA, with the audio files playing randomly within a set time frame for each action (boarding, deboarding, landing, etc.) to simulate a real cabin crew. Furthermore, they have worked hard on integrating GSX, meaning refueling, boarding, cargo, and pushback will be handled automatically by FSDTâs add-on, saving a few clicks.Â  The Electronic Flight Bag was entirely rewritten and made more responsible, with finer control of settings and failures and a built-in quick reference handbook for dealing with the many possible failures the add-on packs in. The flight model has been significantly tweaked, with Fenix Simulations suggesting a specific sensitivity curve for both with and without stick dampening simulation - one of the new features of this update - aiming to make the sidestick feel much more like the real thing. They recommend -20 % on the sensitivities (positive and negative) of the Â L-Axis X and Y, 0% deadzone, and 100% reactivity. Rudder-wise (Joystick R-axis Z), they suggest -40 % sensitivity (positive and negative), 8% deadzone, and 100% reactivity.Â  After a year and a half of development work, itâs no surprise there are so many changes, improvements, and new features. The changelog follows below: â The add-on is available on their official website for roughly $63. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <title>Taimodels Releases Manchester International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-02-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tmmanc"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Taimodels has recently released their rendition of Manchester International Airport (EGCC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the third busiest airport in the United Kingdom with a yearly average of 23.3 million passengers. Construction work began in 1935, and the airport was partially operating by 1937 (the official conclusion happened a year later). KLM was the first airline to launch scheduled commercial flights to the newly opened airport in 1938. It was converted into an RAF base during WW2 and played an essential role in military aircraft production and parachutist training. The post-war period saw its return as a commercial airport, with rapid growth during the 50s and 60s, where it eventually managed to be Britain's second busiest airport after London Heathrow. The airport was heavily expanded in the 80s and 90s to keep up with the exponential growth figures, eventually leading to the millionth passenger in a month mark in 1987. Plans for a new terminal were put in place, and it was opened by Princess Diana as Terminal A in 1989.Â  From 1997 to 2001, a second runway was built, leading to many protests from locals because natural habitats were disturbed and listed buildings had to be demolished, but they didn't have another option. New expansion work started in 2019 to keep up with the ever-growing passenger traffic figures. â EasyJet, Jet2.com, Ryanair, and TUI Airways have operating bases in Manchester. Many airlines from around the Globe serve it, including Air Canada, Air France, Brussels Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad, Finnair, KLM, Kuwait Airways, Lufthansa, Qatar, Scandinavian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Turkish, Virgin Atlantic, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, realistic lighting, custom jetways, performance-friendly optimization, realistic terminals, and custom ground textures. It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $20.85, requiring at least 1.68 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>TDS Sim Software Releases GTNXi Pro with Full Navigraph Data Support for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-02-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/tdgtnp"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/65e10a649702b430b57a5395_tds1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TDS Sim Software has recently introduced the GTNXi Pro navigation suite for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring full compatibility with Navigraphâs navigation database and charts instead of only accepting the - rather expensive - official Garmin navdata.Â  The developers claim there are no setbacks or limitations from using the Navigraph database instead, with the overall experience being indistinguishably similar. The main difference, though, is the pricing: while one can subscribe to Navigraph for as little as $27 (navdata only), Garminâs subscription plan can easily go past the four-digit mark for the worldwide database ($1869/year for the database and charts), which can be a bit steep for flight simulation usage. They have been developing this integration for two years, and itâs said to be their most challenging project yet. Itâs the first time in history that a Garmin-trainer-based GTN was made compatible with Navigraph data.Â  The feature set is the same as the standard GTNXi, delivering an authentic replica of the real GTN 750Xi/650Xi with advanced navigation features, great levels of customization per the real unit, and high-resolution displays with great clarity. The Navigraph integration also features geo-referenced data where available, providing real-time aircraft positioning overlaid on the Jeppesen charts for extra situational awareness. Their data also allows for LPV (Localiser Performance with Vertical Guidance) approaches, RF (radius-to-fix) legs, and much more.Â  â The GTNXi Pro subscription is available as an upgrade from the standard GTNXi for $26.95 or standalone for $70.15 on theirÂ official website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released their rendition of Josep Tarradellas Barcelona - El Prat Airport (LEBL) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Spain's second-largest and second-busiest airport with a yearly average of 49.9 million passengers. El Prat was Barcelona's second airport, built in 1918, after their previous airport (El Remolar) couldn't be expanded any further. It was a base for the Spanish Navy's Zeppelin fleet and was the headquarters of the Aeroclub of Catalonia. Regularly scheduled commercial service started in 1927 with Iberia. Following the end of World War 2, they built its first paved runway, making way for the first scheduled international flight in its history: a Pan American Airways Lockheed Constellation that would come over from New York regularly.Â  The subsequent years brought its first passenger terminal, taxiways, and a second runway, allowing the airport to keep growing. It would handle a million passengers annually within a decade of that construction effort. The airport's growth had halted after the 1970s, and the imminence of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games led to an urgent makeover: two more terminals were built, and jetways were finally introduced. It's a hub for Iberia, Level, Air Nostrum, and Vueling and a focus city for EasyJet and Ryanair. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air Transat, airBaltic, Avianca, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, ITA Airways, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines, and Wizz Air also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, VDGS, custom satellite imagery, elevation data based on LiDAR scans, custom ground poly, realistic night lighting, and more. It's available onÂ OrbxDirectÂ for roughly $14.61, requiring at least 2.37 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Boundless Announces Glasgow Prestwick Airport for X-Plane 11 &amp; 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has recently announced the development of Glasgow Prestwick Airport (EGPK) for X-Plane 11 and 12, the second busiest airport in Glasgow (Scotland), with a yearly average of 445,211 passengers. It was officially opened in 1935 despite operating as an airfield for longer (since the early 1910s). Passenger facilities were added in 1938 and remained untouched until the government made them compatible with jet aircraft. â The RAF used Prestwick to control trans-Atlantic flights during World War 2 as a gateway for US Army personnel and a training base for RAF pilots. â Its commercial duties started right after the war, with a transatlantic flight between Prestwick and New York. â The main runway was expanded in 1960 from the original 2,100 meters to 3,000 meters, which is still its current length. â During the early 1990s, Prestwick was in shambles, desperately needing ârescue,â which came in the form of a takeover from a Canadian entrepreneur (Matthew Hudson), who constructed a railway station beside it, making it the first Scottish airport with its own railway station. To this day, Matthewâs rescue effort is unanimously recognized as heroic. â Ryanair embraced Prestwick in 1994, with a route from Dublin and a second route a year later to London Stansted. A third one followed suit in 1998, taking passengers to Paris-Beauvais. â 1998 also marks the ownership transfer from Matthew Hudson to the Stagecoach Group, a transport group based in Perth, primarily focused on buses, trams, and train services. They sold it three years later for 33 million pounds. â Infratil, a Kiwi company, was the new owner from 2001 onwards, responsible for revamping the main terminal in 2005 and redecorating most of it with very controversial touches. â After over a decade of ownership, Infratil called it a day and passed it on to a new owner, which was no less than the Scottish government. They paid an incredible sum of 1 pound for it. â Itâs currently served by Ryanair, with flights to Alicante, Faro, Lanzarote, MÃ¡laga, and Tenerife-South. â Thereâs no release date, pricing, or feature information, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

PKSIM has recently released their rendition of Melilla Airport (GEML) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Melilla, an autonomous city of Spain in North Africa with a yearly average of 500,000 passengers.Â  â It was opened in 1969, and beforehand, tourists had to visit Melilla through Nador International Airport, then called Tauima Aerodrome, in Morocco (both before and after its independence).Â  Sporting a 1,433-meter-long runway, itâs mostly suitable for small regional aircraft such as the ATR, Dash 8s, etc. While theoretically, an A320/B738 and their smaller variants could land somewhat safely, the maximum fuel range (they canât fill it up entirely because the runway is very short) is not enough to reach most countries in central Europe, making it infeasible. Itâs served by Air Nostrum (Iberia Regional), the only airline connecting Melilla to the World as of 2024. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, PBR textures, GSX compatibility, and more.Â  Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $17.35, requiring at least 389.42 MB of free hard disk space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flightbeam Studios has recently previewed their work on San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator and launched theirÂ Discord serverÂ for future product previews, support, and more. San Francisco International is the second-busiest airport in California, with a yearly average of 57 million passengers, only behind Los Angeles International.Â  Itâs a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. According to Flightbeam, the upcoming scenery will be their most detailed work yet, sitting high above their previous releases regarding visual complexity, quality, and performance, hence the âCaptainâs Editionâ title.Â  â Itâs said to be inching closer to completion, with a potential release happening before summer if things go according to plan. The pictures shared cover International Terminal A and its surroundings, and further previews will be shared closer to release. All the terminals have been revamped from the inside out. Thereâs no price or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you updated! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft/sim-wings have recently updated their rendition of Adolfo SuÃ¡rez Madrid-Barajas Airport (LEMD) for X-Plane 12, bringing SAM improvements, airport functionality tweaks, and more. It was constructed in 1927 and opened in 1931, with commercial operations starting two years after the official inauguration. It was initially unpaved, and the paving process only began in 1940.Â  The National Terminal, now T2, was inaugurated in 1954 after mere months of construction. It was considered a first-class international airport in 1957. Terminal 1 was constructed in the 1970s during the air travel boom, which was a direct consequence of the advent of the Boeing 747. It reached 4 million passengers yearly during the period that led to its construction. In the 1990s, the terminals saw further expansion, which happened again with the construction of Terminal 4 in 2004, significantly increasing its passenger handling capabilities. With a yearly average of 61 million passengers, itâs the busiest airport in Spain and the 5th busiest in Europe. Itâs a hub for Air Europa, Iberia, Iberia Express, Iberia Regional, Plus Ultra LÃ­neas AÃ©reas, and World 2 Fly, and an operating base for Iberojet, Ryanair, and Wamos Air. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, AeromÃ©xico, Air Arabia, Air China, Air France, Air Transat, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Finnair, Korean, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Chile, LATAM PerÃº, Lufthansa, Transavia, Turkish, United Airlines, and WizzAir also serve it. Update 1.1.0 brings a hefty changelog, which follows below: â The scenery is available on theÂ Aerosoft ShopÂ for roughly $25.60, requiring at least 7.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.
