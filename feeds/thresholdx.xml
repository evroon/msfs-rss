    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Flight Sim Labs recently launched their new website design, featuring a landing page for their upcoming A321ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and a selection of screenshots, details, pricing information, and more. The company rose to fame in 2016 after releasing the first high-fidelity Airbus A320 add-on. This add-on allowed Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Prepar3d users to experience the day-to-day operation of one of the most popular airliners, one that had not yet been developed to such standards (which quickly changed within five years). Described as âthe most advanced Airbus A321ceo simulation for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020â, FSLabsâ upcoming bird is said to bring a combination of cutting-edge technology with unrivaled attention to detail, featuring immersive cabin operations, custom MEL (minimum equipment list) systems, next-generation visuals, enhanced systems, dynamic effects, realistic operational hazards, and real-world navigation obstacles such as GPS jamming, based on real-world data.Â  The add-on will retail for $69.99 and feature two engine options (CFM56 and IAE V2500), wingtip fences and/or sharklets, totaling up to four variants included in the package. They have also announced the development of an A321neo next, which is still being worked on but is said to âfollow shortly behindâ the release of the current engine option variant. Owners of the ceo between its release and the Neoâs release will be eligible for a discount. Refer to their website for further information on the upcoming product(s).

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Taimodels has recently launched its rendition of Beijing Daxing International Airport (ZBAD) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This airport, which serves the capital of China alongside Beijing Capital International Airport, opened just five years ago. It accommodates nearly 40 million passengers each year. After years of proposals, the construction of the new airport was officially approved in 2014. Following five years of construction, the airport opened its doors on September 25, 2019, with its first commercial flight occurring the next day. The airport serves as a hub for six airlines: Air China, Beijing Capital Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China United Airlines, and XiamenAir. Additionally, it is a focus city for Hebei Airlines. However, the airport is not limited to these carriers; it accommodates numerous airlines from around the globe, offering flights to various destinations, including Hong Kong, Amsterdam, Doha, and many more. The newly released version of Beijing Daxing International Airport includes realistic terminals, airport buildings, PBR ground markings, realistic lighting, custom jetways, and other features. The scenery requires 4.54 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for about $23.44. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

The airport serves the Jackson metropolitan area and has a yearly average of 1 million passengers. The airport opened in 1963, replacing Hawkins Field, Jacksonâs former main airport since 1928. Construction took around three years and cost 6 million USD (equivalent to 56,000,000 USD in 2023).Â  Itâs named after Medgar Evers (since 2005), a Mississippi Field Secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who was assassinated in June 1963.Â Â Â  The airport is served by American Eagle (Charlotte, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington-National), Delta Air Lines (Atlanta), Southwest Airlines (Atlanta, Baltimore, Houston-Hobby, Orlando), and United Express (Houston-Intercontinental). In addition to passenger flights, the airport handles cargo shipments, with UPS flying to Louisville. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-placed night lighting, 3D vegetation, weather effects (X-Plane 12 only), high-quality PBR texturing, custom terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on X-Plane.Orgâs Store for $17.99, requiring at least 1.6 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>iniBuilds Releases Brisbane Airport for MSFS 2024 </title>
    <updated>2024-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/inibne"/>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Brisbane Airport (YBBN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. Brisbane Airport is the largest airport in Australia by land area and the third busiest in passenger traffic, with a yearly average of 23.2 million passengers. The airportâs construction started in 1980. Built by Leighton Contractors, it cost 400 million dollars and opened eight years later. It initially had a domestic terminal and two runways. Nearly a decade later, in September 1995, the international terminal was inaugurated, bringing in further passenger traffic. In 2007, the government approved the construction of a new parallel runway, which was expected to take eight years to build on swamp land 2 kilometers west of the terminal area. The unexpectedly long construction time was due to the settling period of the 13,000,000 cubic meters of sand gathered from Moreton Bay to cover the swamp. Work was completed in 2020, costing $1 billion and taking precisely eight years from start to finish. Itâs a hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia. Air Canada, Air Niugini, Alliance Airlines, American Airlines, Batik Air Malaysia, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, EVA Air, Fiji Airways, FlyPelican, Jetstar, Korean Air, Link Airways, National Jet Express, Nauru Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, QantasLink, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Skytrans Airlines, Solomon Airlines, United Airlines, VietJet Air, and Virgin Australia also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom dynamic lighting, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, and an up-to-date layout.Â  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $22.72, requiring at least 8.32 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Headwind Simulations has recently released updates for its A339X and SU95X projects for MSFS. The new update integrates SayIntentions.AI ACARS and CPDLC into both aircraft. SayIntentions.AI is an AI ATC (Air Traffic Control) plugin designed for various flight simulators. It provides features such as ATC, copilots, cabin crew, and more, all powered by artificial intelligence. A key component of the ATC functionality in SayIntentions.AI includes ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) and CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications). These systems facilitate communication between the ground and the aircraft, allowing for interactions between air traffic controllers and pilots. â With the recent integration of ACARS and CPDLC from SayIntentions.AI into Headwind Simulationâs aircraft, users can now access these features. Please note that a Premium Membership is required to utilise this feature.  The latest updates for the A339X and the SU95X are now accessible via the Headwind Simulations installer. Since the update is part of the pre-release channels, be sure to select this option for the most recent update. For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
