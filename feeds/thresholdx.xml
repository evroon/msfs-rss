    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. MXI Design recently released its version of Ãrebro Airport (ESOE) for X-Plane 12. Located just over 6 miles from the city of Ãrebro, the airport is the 23rd largest airport in Sweden in terms of passengers. It serves around 80,000 passengers yearly and is also involved in various cargo operations. Ãrebro Airport opened in 1978 after discussions about a new airport in the region were ongoing in the early 50s and 60s. The airport initially had a 1,300-meter-long runway, which has now been extended to 3,300 meters. In the 1990s, the airport started to focus on cargo operations in addition to passenger transport. In terms of regional freight, Ãrebro Airport is the largest in all of Sweden. The airport is currently used by several airlines, including Ryanair, Sunclass Airlines, and ASL Airlines France, for both passenger and cargo operations. The scenery package includes an accurate and highly detailed rendition of the airport, an up-to-date ground layout, basic interior, PBR implementation, animated flags, 3D passengers, custom aerial imagery, and more. The newly released Ãrebro Airport requires 2.14 GB of storage space, and it is available on both SimMarket and Orbx for approximately $13.10. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Updates 777-300ER for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777037"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66904e3dbe652ec8847e6d37_ana1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued a new update to their newly released Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator, bringing a few more fixes to the WASM issues, sound tweaks, and news on future updates for the DC-6 and 737s.Â  In an unusual fashion, the forum post begins with a paragraph on a future DC-6 update, which will improve texture clarity on gauges and dials and many of the placards and indicators throughout the flight deck. The update stems from what they have learned with the 737 and 777, which were initially applied on an experimental basis but were deemed too good to be kept private. The following bit details an SU15-induced issue that led to the aircraft freezing entirely, although the simulator would keep running. They claim it has to do with changes in how the platform handles C++ code issues that otherwise wouldnât cause crashes. PMDG has been working hard to find and mitigate the triggers to provide maximum stability.Â  Said fixes are being rolled out gradually on the 777 and will also be rolled out to the 737 in due time. A beta version has been pushed out to their testers so they can ensure itâs working fine before a full rollout. PMDG is confident that update 2.00.0037 will give the 777 stability and protection against the SU15 issues that were unmasked with the help of their testers and customers. They have found most of the root causes and dealt with them accordingly.Â  With that being said, their âguard is still up,â and bug reports are still being constantly evaluated, with more fixes on the way.Â  The next update is already being worked on, and itâs anticipated to include a fix for the long filenames problem and a potential new feature: Navigraph data might be updated through the Ultimate Flight Tablet. Other fixes are also pending. The changelog for todayâs update follows below: â The 777-300ER is available on PMDG.com for $77.73.

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Orbx has released a new update for its Kola map for DCS. The update includes new features and improvements. The main feature of the update is a set of winter textures, allowing users to explore the harsh and cold climate of the North. Further improvements to the map have been made based on community feedback. The update includes new winter textures that accurately represent cold climates. These textures will be adjusted based on the date of the mission. Additionally, the update features the Port of Kirkenes and includes enhancements within the Russian/Finnish border. Based on community feedback, the new update includes several improvements. These include performance optimizations, corrected placement of wind turbines, removal of orange trees from fields, and increased depth of the Polyarny harbor. All these improvements have been made to ensure that the map is as accurate as possible. The updated add-on is currently available on Orbx for $57.66 during early access and will increase to $69.99 upon full release. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Parallel 42 Releases 777 Immersion Pack for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-07-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/777ime"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66916d0b19060b9b782afb42_par1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Parallel 42 recently released their 777 Immersion package for Microsoft Flight Simulatorâpart of their SimFX add-onâaiming to improve the overall realism of the effects for the PMDG 777 (and CaptainSim, eventually) with condensation, realistic chemtrails, brake smoke, and more. Available as a single package for all major renditions of the triple seven airframe regardless of the livery used, bringing immersive effects for the PMDG and CaptainSim (at a later date) and customized for each with performance as their top priority.Â  Built on the SimFx framework, it offers the best combination of effects and customizability via the SimFx interface. For the unaware, Parallel 42âs SimFX is a visual effects utility covering a range of immersive scenarios. Environmental variables and formulas authentically govern every particle on the screen, and dynamic effects appear under the right conditions, creating unique moments in the virtual skies. The effects include contrails, heat blurs, wing wash, rotor wash, and more. Their immersion package for the 777 builds on top of what SimFx already offers, bringing nineteen custom effects for the mighty triple seven, including swirling contrails, condensation effects, waste water drain every hour, engine cold start effects, fuel jettison, cloud illumination, hot brakes smoke, carbon brake dust, and water droplets. The APU heat blur and the St. Elmoâs fire are not supported because of a development choice by PMDG, using a deprecated technique preventing SimFX or 777 Immersion from injecting their version of those effects. The package is available on Contrail for roughly $15.00, requiring at least 2 MB of free hard disk space to install. Bear in mind that the 777 Package requires SimFX to work.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds has recently released their rendition of Dubrovnik RuÄer BoÅ¡koviÄ Airport (LDDU) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving Dubrovnik-Neretva County with a yearly average of 2.4 million passengers. The airport opened in 1962 and quickly became Yugoslaviaâs busiest. By 1987, it had already served nearly a million passengers.Â  In the 2000s, a new passenger terminal was built to replace the original from 1962, costing the administration 70 million euros. Itâs the most modern terminal in the country so far.Â  Itâs a hub for Croatia Airlines and many other European carriers, including Air France, British Airways, easyJet, Eurowings, Finnair, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizz Air, serve it on a seasonal basis. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, custom night lighting, highly detailed models of all airport buildings, an up-to-date layout, and a custom GSX profile.Â  Itâs available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $19.36, requiring at least 3.94 GB of free hard disk space to install.
