    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FSDG has released their rendition of Teruel Airport (LETL) for X-Plane 12. Officially known as Plataforma Aeroportuaria-Teruel (PLATA), this airport serves as an aircraft storage and maintenance facility for Tarmac Aerosave - a company specialising in aircraft maintenance and storage. After being used as an airfield during the Spanish Civil War in 1936-1939, the location of Teruel Airport was a firing range for the Spanish Air Force for a long time, before plans for a new commercial airport were made. Construction work began in 2009 and after 4 years, Teruel Airport was officially opened in February 2013, after receiving certification from AESA (Spanish Aviation Safety and Security Agency) for public use. Throughout the years, many more platforms for long-storage were made, increasing the number of available stands from 24 to 84. In 2016, Teruel Airport was one of the few airports that were used in testing of the A400M. During the same year, a flight school opened with a base at Teruel. The latest expansion included the construction of a new parking area. Meteorological conditions, location and low density of traffic made Teruel a perfect place for long-term storage facilities. Aside from Tarmac Aerosave, the Spanish space launch agency, PLD Space, also uses this airport to test launch vehicle technology. FSDGâs rendition of Teruel Airport features an authentic light environment, static aircraft, dynamic lighting, reflective textures, and optimisation for great performance and visual results. This scenery is made for X-Plane 12 but is compatible with X-Plane 11.30+ as well. It is available for purchase on SimMarket for roughly $11.85. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Cowan Simulation has just released their Eurocopter EC130 (also named Airbus H130) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The Eurocopter EC130 is a single-engine light helicopter developed after the Eurocopter AS350. It was launched and produced by the Eurocopter Group, which would later be rebranded as Airbus Helicopters.Â  During the early 1990s, the development of a new helicopter, based on the Eurocopter AS350, began. The main difference was the adoption of Fenestron instead of a conventional tail rotor.Â  On 24th June 1999, the first prototype of EC130 performed its first flight. Apart from the Fenestron, the EC130 also featured a dual-hydraulic system and a wider fuselage. It was introduced in 2001 by Blue Hawaiian Helicopters, who were the launch operator. Powered by a single Turbomeca Ariel 2D Turboshaft engine, EC130 can fly at altitudes of 23,000ft for 4 hours, with a range of 327nm with a Vne of 155kts. Cowan Simulationâs rendition of EC130 features a detailed manual, paint kit, realistic systems, MEDEVAC version, 3 cockpit variants (G530/430/GTN/GX3 Touch/Analog), PMS or TDS GTN/GTNXi 650 and 750 integration (PC only), floats version, 50 liveries, functional spot/search lights, animated Cineflex camera, 4K PBR textures, detailed night lighting and accurate 3D modelling.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TechnoBrain has recently released its version of Yao Airport (RJOY) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Yao Airport is a small airport in the city of Yao, located in the Osaka Prefecture, Japan. The airport serves general aviation and is also an airbase for the JGSDF, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. It is situated approximately 8.1 nautical miles from the centre of Osaka and does not have any scheduled airline services. In 1938, the airport started as Hanshin Aviation School. In 1940, the airport was renamed and seized by the army, becoming known as TaishÅ Airfield. The army also expanded the airport. After World War II, occupation forces named the airport Hansin Airfield. Later, the airport was returned to the Japanese. Today, the airport accommodates general aviation traffic and also offers charter flights and sightseeing flights. It has cross-runways and is located not far from the centre of Osaka. The newly released version of Yao Airport comes with a variety of features, including custom taxiway signs and ground markings, dynamic lighting, PBR materials, and much more.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Teikof Studio recently released their rendition of Antonio NariÃ±o Airport (SKPS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Pasto, Colombia, and has a yearly average of 333,600 passengers. The exact date of the airport's construction remains unclear, but its development was driven by the need for improved connectivity in a region known for its mountainous terrain. Building an airport on flat land proved difficult, so engineers opted for a daring solution: constructing a runway on a plateau 50 meters above the surrounding area. This distinctive feature has earned the airport the nickname "aircraft carrier" among pilots, referencing its resemblance to a flat-topped ship on a sea of land. One of its most notable aspects is its runway: due to the high elevation and surrounding terrain, it is relatively short, posing a challenge for larger aircraft. However, significant improvements have been made over the years. Since 2007, the addition of an instrument landing system (ILS) has allowed for safer operations during low visibility and nighttime conditions. âCrosswinds also pose another significant challenge, especially during the summer months. Pilots must possess a high degree of skill and experience to navigate these conditions safely. â Pasto Airport's dependence on good visibility conditions and tame winds will eventually lead to its replacement, as it won't be able to keep up with the projected passenger traffic demand.Â  Avianca (BogotÃ¡, Cali), Clic (Cali), and LATAM Colombia (BogotÃ¡) serve it.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with a detailed terminal, custom ground textures, custom terraforming, and more. It's available on the MSFS Marketplace for $9.99.Â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of a new Accu-Sim airplane for Microsoft Flight Simulator: the Piper Aerostar 600, a twin-engined propeller aircraft designed and built by Ted Smith Aircraft Company in the late 1960s.Â  Ted Smith, then an already experienced aircraft designer, envisioned a fast twin-engined airplane with no compromises, sleek lines, powerful engines, and speed as the main priority. By the late 1960s, the first prototype was already breaking records, making it the fastest twin-piston general aviation aircraft at the time, thanks to its light construction, low drag, and sheer power.Â  â The Aerostar 600 had two Lycoming IO-540-K engines, producing 290 horsepower each. These allowed it to cruise at 408 km/h, with a service ceiling of 25,000ft and 1,500 miles of total range on a single tank of fuel.Â  â Like their Comanche 250 (released mid-2023), the upcoming airplane will be built on Accu-Sim 2.0 technology. This technology features an advanced aerodynamics system that tries to accurately represent how an aircraft flies through the air, realistic wear and tear on the airframe and engine, in-depth electrical simulation, and much more.Â  â They have owned and operated a real Aerostar 600 for several years, and it was assumed for the longest time that it would be their first product for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  Not much has been revealed yet, but they mention itâs an entirely different experience from flying the Comanche, with their Accu-Sim 2.0 technology accurately recreating the feel of flying a piston twin. Itâs expected to be released âlater in 2024.â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The Cessna CitationJet is a series of light business jets, and are a part of the Citation family. Launched in 1989, the CJ 525 had its first flight in October 1991. Using the Citation IIâs fuselage, the CJ 525 has a different wing box and T-tail design. After the original CJ proved to be a success, the 525 received an upgrade in avionics and engines and was marketed as CJ1, CJ1+, and M2, depending on the equipment the aircraft had.Â  Aside from the original 525 model, Cessna also produced prolonged versions: 525A, 525B and 525C. All of these versions later received avionics and engine upgrades and were marketed as CJ2, CJ3 and CJ4, respectively. During the testing phase, various aspects of TorqueSimâs CJ525 will be tested and examined, such as flight dynamics, systems accuracy, visual fidelity, and performance testing.Â  As of the publishing of this article, no information about the release date or pricing of this addon has been released, however, make sure to keep an eye out as Threshold will keep you updated with the progress of TorqueSimâs CitationJet 525! â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>
