    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iniBuilds have posted a preview of their new work in progress scenery on their Instagram today. The picture shows a garage followed by a sign saying âTerminal Car Park 2â. Threshold did some digging and found that this render resembles the Car Park next to London Luton Airport. This garage suffered a fire in 2023 and since then has been closed to the public. Situated north of London, and considered to be one of Londonâs 5 major airports, London Luton Airport (EGGW) is one of the biggest hubs for low-cost airlines, used mostly by Ryanair and EasyJet, and during the day, this airport sees over 170 movements. In 2022, Luton reached a record number of over 13.3 million passengers, which is more than 9 million passengers compared to a year earlier.  â iniBuilds has not announced a release date, pricing, or even confirmed that it is indeed London Luton yet, so stay tuned for more information - Threshold will keep you informed! </summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released their rendition of Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (KCVG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Cincinnati is a global cargo hub for DHL Aviation, Kalitta Air, Atlas Air, ABX Air, and Amazon Air, placing it 6th for the busiest cargo hub in the USA, and 12th in the world. Opened in 1944 as a training airport during WWII, the airport got its first passenger terminal two years later, with the first arrival being an American Airlines DC-3 from Cleveland. In mid-1980, CVG became one of Deltaâs hubs, increasing yearly airport operations by 200.000, and doubling passenger volumes by to 20 million passengers handled per year. During its peak in 2005, CVG handled more than 600 flights a day. The airport consists of four runways (three parallel and one perpendicular), a single terminal and two concourses, Concourse A - that has 23 gates, and Concourse B -with 28 gates. CVG also serves as a third biggest world hub for DHL (The other two being Leipzig-Halle and Hong Kong) and as a main shipping hub for Amazon Air operating with more than 50 767-300/200F. FeelThereâs rendition of Cincinnati International Airport includes the following features: This scenery is available on SimMarket for $19.50USD and takes only 1.03GB of space on disk. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more high quality flight simulation news, reviews, and editorials!</summary>

    <title>Aerosoft Releases Saint-Tropez Airport for X-Plane 12</title>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of The Airport of the Golfe of Saint Tropez (LFTZ), serving the commune of Saint-Tropez, France, with a yearly average of 7,000 to 10,000 passengers. It was built in 1964 by Count FranÃ§ois Gazeau and Marc Den Bosch as a strip of land stretching between the then national road and the river. The land belonged to Charles Boyer de Fonscolombe, who agreed to rent it out to FranÃ§ois and Marc in memory of Saint-ExupÃ©ry, who happened to be one of his close cousins. In the early 1980s, Charles Boyer entrusted the airportâs operation to a management company, which further developed the airport in the 1990s to provide the region with an adequately structured airport. In that same decade, the runway was made public after an agreement with the state, remaining open 365 days a year for daylight operations only. A new passenger terminal was built in 1995, significantly increasing the passenger handling capabilities and adding a bar. Â  Itâs mostly a general aviation airport, which accounts for most of its yearly aircraft movements. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with revised lighting, PBR reflections, custom ortophoto, custom vegetation, weather effects for wet, snow, and ice, revised autogen, reworked static aircraft (togglable), and more. Itâs available on theÂ Aerosoft ShopÂ for roughly $13.64, requiring at least 1.9 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>WINWING Reveals Pre-Order Date for A320 FCU</title>
    <updated>2024-03-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/winwng"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/660091f91a2014d31b525b1d_FCU_PC_homepage_fff.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: OTHER. WINWING, a well-known hardware producer in the mil-sim community has recently expanded into the civil flight sim community with their newest product - a full-size A320 FCU. Known for their hardware, they have established themselves as a high-quality producer of HOTAS, MIP (Main Instrument Panel), rudder pedals, and Joystick grips for various fighter jets. â Showcased a couple of days ago on their YouTube channel, WINWING unveiled the launch of the Full-size FCU for A320. In the trailer, along with the Flight Control Unit, we could notice that EFIS and glare wing are also present in the trailer. Along with the video, the price was also revealed: â On their Facebook page, they have unveiled the pre-order date: March 27 at 02:00UTC. They have also disclosed an expected shipping date - which is supposed to be in early May. â The trailer shows that the FCU backlighting can be adjusted, and WINWING claims that it is auto-synced with the plane. All the knobs have the recognizable Airbus push-pull mechanism and the look of the knobs is very similar, if not the same, as in real Airbus.Â  â The screen panel features two orange integrated LCDs, with realistic segment code.Â  â One thing that caught my eye, the EXPED button (button under the ALT knob) seems to be missing. It turns out that WINWING decided to make the button unmarked, but still functional. The user can change its functions to their choice (FD, LS, and CSTR buttons are just some of the countless options the user can adjust to their liking). â The third button in the row below, it is a solid color surface. On the WW FCU, it is still a functional button, just styled in this way. Because in reality, the original 320 button is also like this, and the rapid climb and descent function is basically prohibited by airlines for normal use. â It seems that there are more Airbus products in development, in addition to the FCU. Later on in the trailer, EFIS panels and glare-wings are unveiled. Although it is unknown when will these two be released, or what their price will be, we can be sure to expect them in the A320 product lineup. Interestingly enough, this isnât WINWINGâs first Airbus product, as a quick look at their store shows that they also offer A3XX sidestick, which explains why the sidesticks are also colored, along with the glareshield. â Be sure to stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news, reviews, and editorials! â â â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of Myrtle Beach International Airport (KMYR) for X-Plane 12, serving Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with a yearly average of 3.3 million passengers. It was built on property from a former air base, transferred by the government through the Surplus Property Act. Initially, the city of Myrtle Beach did not want to use the property for an airport, but the funds had to be used for an airport, which meant they funded Horry County Airport instead for 18 years. It wasnât until 1977 that the city annexed the area of Myrtle Beach Airport, with the airport and the Air Force Base sharing the same runway until 1993 when the AFB closed, and the portions of the former military flight line were turned over to the County. Myrtle Beach became an international airport in 1996 and got a brand new passenger terminal for that exact purpose. Twelve years later, it underwent two major renovation projects to modernize the infrastructure. Itâs currently undergoing expansion work, with six new gates being added to Terminal A, bringing the total number of gates to 18 and significantly increasing the traffic handling capabilities. Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Avelo Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines currently serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, custom autogen, high-resolution PBR ground textures, animated car traffic, 4K textures, 3D grass, color-graded satellite imagery, HDR night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on theÂ Verticalsim ShopÂ for roughly $14.99, and X-Plane 11 users are eligible for a $9.99 upgrade fee.Â  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
