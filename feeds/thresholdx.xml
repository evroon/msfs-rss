    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Skyward Simulations has recently previewed its first project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Diamond DA-50RG. The DA-50RG is a modern single-engined aircraft, powered by a 300HP turbodiesel engine. The sleek airframe is made of carbon fiber, which sets a new bar for aircraft construction. The aircraft can fly at 20,000 feet at a speed of 180 knots. Together with great fuel consumption, these features make the DA-50RG one of the best modern general aviation aircraft. According to Skyward, The DA-50RG will feature an accurate 3D model, true-to-life definition textures, Custom-coded systems, ground idle function simulation, accurate flight model, integrated WortkingTittle G1000NXI, hand-made liveries, and immersive custom sounds by Boris Audio Works.  The addon will cost around 16.12 USD, but as of the publishing of this article, the release date is yet to be announced. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Boundless has released their rendition of North Weald Airfield for X-Plane 11 and 12, a small General Aviation airfield in Essex, UK. Opened in 1916 as Royal Flying Corps Station North Weald Bassett Aerodrome by the Royal Flying Corps (predecessor to the Royal Air Force), and in 1918 it became a Royal Air Force airport. This airfield played an important role in defending British skies during WWII. Hawker Hurricanes stationed in North Weald Airfield saw action in Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. Later on in the war, Norwegian squadrons were reassigned to this airfield. Between the 1940s and 60s, this aerodrome was used for RAF glider training. The last combat unit left North Weald in 1958, while the RAF completely withdrew in 1964, and since then this aerodrome has been classified as civilian. Today, North Weald sees over 40,000 movements on average per year and is home to a collection of vintage and veteran aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, Douglas Dakota, Curtiss Kittyhawk, as well as early jet aircraft such as Hawker Hunter, de Havilland Venom, de Havilland Vampire, Folland Gnat and BAC Jet Provost. North Weald Airfield will feature up-to-date orthophotos, 4K PBR airport buildings, 3D Forrest (XP12 only), 3D vegetation, 3D volumetric grass, Custom night lighting, realistic HD static aircraft, accurate ground markings including cracks and wear &amp; tear, dynamic weather effects (XP12 only) and accurate airport layout based on latest charts.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Sky-Additions has recently released their rendition of Paris-Vatry Airport (LFOK) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It serves the champagne region in Northeastern France and is close enough to Paris (135km) to be considered by Ryanair as one of the Parisian airports. As of 2018, the airport had a yearly average of 61,826 passengers. It was built as an air base in 1953, housing fifty fighters in three large hangars. When France withdrew from the integrated NATO structure in 1967, the Americans left the base, leading to its closure. The French Air Force then used it for training until the early 2000s, when it was sold to civil interests and converted into a civilian airport. Besides handling occasional passenger traffic, itâs also a training pilot site for many airlines, such as Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, KLM, Transavia, Transavia France, and Swiss. Airbus has also used its relatively long runway for aircraft testing. Itâs served by Ryanair, with flights to Marrakech and Porto.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout, a custom GSX profile, detailed environmental elements, realistic airport vehicles, custom ground markings, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $9.64, requiring at least 120.97 MB of free hard disk space to install.
