    <summary>Sim: DCS. Threshold recently received exclusive screenshots of the upcoming Kola Map for DCS, and today, we have three more exclusives to share with you. The community has highly anticipated the new Kola Map, which will cover large parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. As of now, the project is listed as "coming soon," with the release of the early access version imminent. The Kola Map will first be available for early access and will be feature-packed with a multitude of airports. There will be two airports in Finland, five in Russia, two in Norway, and three in Sweden. Additionally, early access ensures a complete base terrain, highly detailed topography for the entire map, and lots of POIs, road and railroad networks, night lighting, and many landmarks to explore. Although early access will be available first, many future features have already been planned. Winter textures are scheduled to ensure the representation of the cold and harsh climate up North. A multitude of military airfields like Bardufoss and Kirkenes and a variety of civilian airports, including TromsÃ¸ and LuleÃ¥, are also planned. Also, general improvements to landscape features have been scheduled. The official store page for the Kola Map is now available on Orbx. Be sure to check it out for more information and screenshots. â We will update you with more information as soon as it becomes available. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>Stellar Simulations Releases Bacolod-Silay Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Stellar Simulations has recently released their rendition of Bacolod-Silay Airport (RPVB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Bacolod Metropolitan Area with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers as of 2022. The airportâs site was initially used as an airfield during World War 2 but was abandoned immediately after. Parts of the airfield became a sugarcane plantation. In 1997, a Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) study indicated the need for expansion at four Philippine airports, and Bacolod City Domestic Airport was one of them. It was relatively small for the traffic it was getting, and expansion was impossible, which led to the construction of a brand-new airport. Construction started in 2004, with a 900-day deadline to complete it. During the digging work, the remains of the former WW2 airfield and aircraft wrecks were found. The airportâs construction was considered complete by mid-2007, but there was debate at the time due to a pending runway extension that wasnât complete yet. Commercial operations started in January 2008, replacing the old Bacolod City Domestic Airport.Â  Cebgo, Cebu Pacific, PAL Express, and Philippines AirAsia serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, a custom terminal interior, landside buildings, an up-to-date ground layout, custom ground clutter, and more. â Itâs available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $10.69, requiring at least 360.74 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Verticalsim has recently released their rendition of St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (KPIE) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the Tampa Bay Area with a yearly average of 2.5 million passengers as of 2023. Construction started in 1941 and was acquired shortly after by the United States Army Air Forces to be used as a training base. It was returned to the County after the end of WW2, renamed Pinellas International Airport. Its current name only came to be in 1958 because Pinellas County was not a very attractive name from a tourist standpoint, according to the airport manager (people didnât know where it was). The administration spent $22 million on heavy renovation work in 2009, which included larger gates, jetways, new plumbing, and overall modernization. â Itâs an operating base for Allegiant Air, which flies to a wide range of destinations. Sun Country, Minneapolisâ local airline, also flies to St. Pete seasonally. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, LODs for optimization, a simple terminal for optimal performance, custom static models, custom taxiway signage, high-resolution PBR texturing, custom aerial imagery, an official GSX profile, and more. Itâs available onÂ ContrailÂ for roughly $16.99, requiring at least 1.76 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Thranda has just released their rendition of the Pilatus PC-6 Turbo Porter for X-Plane 12. Thanks to its superb STOL performance, and easy-to-maintain design, it is used all around the globe to deliver goods where regular aircraft cannot fly. With its first flight in 1959, the PC-6 Porter was produced at Pilatus Flugzeugwerke in Switzerland. It has been built in both a piston engine version and a turboprop-powered version and was also produced under license by Fairchild Hiller in the USA. After 604 planes were built, during a span of 63 years, Pilatus ended its production in 2022. â Powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-27 turboprop 550 hp engine, the Turbo Porter can cruise at an altitude up to 26.800 feet, with a maximum speed of 125 knots. This gives the plane a range of 1,612 km (870 nm) or 730 km (390 nm) with maximum payload. Due to its amazing STOL capability, the Pilatus PC-6 can take from a runway as short as 195 meters (640ft) and land within a distance of 130 meters (427ft). Thanks to its performance, it holds the record for the highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at 18.865 feet (5,750 m), on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal. â The Thranda PC-6 is a part of the DGS - Dynamic Generation Series, which takes full advantage of X-Planeâs flexibility and in-sim modifications. Some of the included features are: customizing a livery in-sim, changing instrument layouts with different panel configs, switching between different airframe configurations, high-fidelity and precise flight dynamics, and much more. Some of the notable features available in the XP12 version are:Â  The EFB has loads of apps, such as the Aircraft Options App, Weight and Balance app, Instrument Options app, Dynamic Panel app, Static Livery app, DynaFeel app, Log Book app, Checklist app, Ground handling app, Dynamic Livery app, Flight Computer app, and more. Thranda Pilatus PC-6 Turbo Porter is available for purchase on the X-Plane.org store for 44.95$, requiring at least 4.1GB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

The DA-50RG is a single-engine aircraft made out of a carbon fiber airframe, mostly used for general aviation and training purposes. Introduced in 2007, it was designed to replace the aging single-engine DA-40. After the Economic Recession in 2009, the DA-50 project was put on hold, and by 2019, no model other than a prototype was made. In 2020, a new version with a Continental CD-300 engine and retractable gear was announced. Later on, it became known as the DA-50RG. With a service ceiling of 20,000ft and a maximum speed of 191 knots, the Diamond DA-50 has a range of 750 nm (1389 km). Skyward Simulations DA-50RG comes with an accurate 3D model, True-to-life definition textures, Custom-coded systems, including ECU &amp; TKS, Ground Idle function simulated, Accurate flight model, Working Title Garmin G1000NXI integration, Included handpainted liveries, and immersive custom sounds by Boris Audio Works.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Backwood Studios have recently released their rendition of Eddsfield Airfield for Microsoft Flight Simulator, a little airfield in East Yorkshire. Edd Peacock created the airfield in the early 90s and is still in operation today.

Nestled in the Yorkshire countryside and surrounded by hills and endless green fields, it gives out a specific, calming charm.Â  â Old Eddâs Trailer Cafe can be found in the heart of the airfield. This antique-like building offers a feel of how life used to be during the good olâ times. It doesnât matter if you came here to grab a bite between your flights, or to listen to stories from other aviators and veterans, Eddsfield is ready to welcome you! This scenery features automated hangar doors, animated people and animals, night lighting, custom 3D-modelled vehicles and buildings, a fully functional fuel station, GA parking, and over 50 km of custom-added roads. Eddsfield Airfield is available for purchase on Orbx for 7.52 USD and requires at least 0.97GB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>
