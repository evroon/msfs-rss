    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG recently published a new development update for their current and future products, including a new 737 lineup update, a 777 product line (new and upcoming variants), and a 747 Classic project. The 737NG lineup has been updated to v3.00.0112. This update primarily focuses on fixing the ongoing issues with the Universal Flight Tablet, trying to reduce or wholly eliminate the eternally spinning PMDG logo bug. Minor fixes on other fronts also further refine the productâs stability. â Their main plan for the 737NG lineup was to stabilize it further, and their focus has now shifted back to their upcoming products. Extra effort will eventually be put into the revamped version for MSFS 2024, with new model upgrades, sounds, and an entirely new sound engine. â The 777-200ER is still being readied for beta testing. Its release is planned to be MSFS 2020 only at first and then a free upgrade to MSFS 2024 later. The 200LR, which is set to come right after, will follow the same order. â Regarding the upcoming 747 project, PMDG is still unsure whether the first to be released will be the -100 or the -400, as both are advancing as core development projects. Work has sped up quite significantly since they moved part of the 777 development team to the project. â They have also previewed part of the modeling work on the 747-100s cockpit, reinforcing that wear, tear, and proper labeling have not yet been added.Â  Given the 747-100s manual nature of systems management, they will implement a virtual copilot and virtual flight engineer to help manage their systems efficiently and realistically, albeit with an option to disable them if desired. PMDG claims itâs still âtoo soonâ for 747-400 cockpit previews, but the systems simulation work is well advanced. â The 747-100 previews are the first to deviate from PMDGâs usual modus operandi: instead of sharing images only when the product is nearly finished / ready for testing, they show it early in its development stage. â Their product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Robert Randazzo, PMDG's CEO, recently made an announcement post in their forum with further information on how their product line is faring with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's latest public beta update and where they now stand regarding the eventual compatibility upgrade. They built the triple 777 in MSFS 2024 using the latest SDK, and it ran in a "mostly stable fashion" with debuggers attached. The airplane operated through an entire flight, and the many issues that showed up in the process were cataloged. They will be addressed starting next week to warrant the best experience possible. That means they have removed the "blockers" that were preventing them from starting work on the compatibility upgrade, and now they can finally begin the process. â While it does run in MSFS 2024 already, it's not truly usable yet as many things don't work properly and require further adjustment. â In Randazzo's words, their optimism needle for MSFS 2024 has "moved to the mid position," and PMDG looks forward to bringing its simulation value to the new platform.Â  â PMDG's product lineup is available on their website, with prices ranging from $34.99 to $74.99.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has recently released their rendition of the Grumman TBF Avenger for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This WW2-era airplane was developed for the United States Navy and Marine Corps and eventually adopted by many air and naval aviation services worldwide. It was designed in 1940 to replace the Douglas TBD Devastator, offering an airplane that was very much in line with the technology adopted by the Axis forces at the time, in complete contrast to the Devastator, which was considered obsolete by 1939. The Avenger was designed to easily fit in aircraft carriers, with easily stowable wings that allowed way more airplanes to fit in the same carrier.Â  With a maximum speed of 447 km/h, 1456km of total range, and a service ceiling of 22,600 feet, the mighty Avenger was one of the most iconic World War 2 bombers, permanently changing naval warfare.Â  Crafted with Paul Bennetâs expertise (an aerobatic pilot who happens to own one of the last airworthy Avengers), the add-on features realistic aerodynamics, high-quality sounds, high-quality 3D modeling and texturing, and much more. Itâs available on OrbxDirect for roughly $17.68, requiring at least 2.23 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSoares has recently teased the development progress on his Rio de Janeiro/GaleÃ£o International Airport (SBGL) rendition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. This is the main airport serving Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a yearly average of 14.5 million passengers. It was opened in 1952 on top of a preexisting Brazilian Air Force base that was utilized by international long-haulers, which were too heavy and too large for SBRJâs (Rioâs domestic airport) 1300m runway. With the ever-increasing international demand, they finally built a passenger terminal, which was progressively expanded until 1977. A new terminal building was opened that year, and all scheduled passenger traffic was transferred there. Itâs still in use today as Terminal 1. Terminal 1 was first renovated in 1991 in preparation for the United Nations Earth Summit (held in 1992), and its annual capacity increased to 7.5 million passengers. Eight years later, Terminal 2 was opened, with 24 jetways and a capacity of up to 7.5 million passengers yearly. âWith the imminence of the World Cup and the Olympic Games in 2014 and 2016, respectively, Infraero (the airportâs former manager) unveiled a $431 million upgrade and expansion plan for GaleÃ£o, including the renovation of Terminal 1, the completion of Terminal 2, and the expansion of the parking lots. The new concessionary revised the plans and included a new pier with 26 jetways, a new apron for 97 aircraft, and 2640 parking spaces. The $400 million sum quickly jumped to $800 million instead. AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, Azul, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Flybondi, Gol, Iberia, ITA Airways, JetSmart Argentina, JetSmart Chile, KLM, Latam Brasil, Latam Chile, Latam Peru, Lufthansa, Paranair, Sky Airlines, TAP, United Airlines, and Voepass serve it. â There is no information on features, pricing, or a release date yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. FlightFX recently announced a release date for their upcoming Piaggio Avanti II for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, along with the release of a launch trailer and pricing information. The Piaggio Avanti II is an evolution of the Piaggio Avanti, originally introduced in late 1990 after four years of flight testing. The original concept goes even further back to 1979, when engineering studies started, and design choices were tested in wind tunnels in the subsequent years by Professor Jan Roskam from the University of Kansas and Professor Gerald Gregorek from Ohio State University. The final design choice was finally made in 1982, with the fuselage development starting a year later. The first prototype only took off in 1986, with the Italian certification to come in early 1990. The Avanti II got certified in late 2005, featuring an uprated Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66B turboprop engines, flying faster and more economically, and a new Rockwell Collins glass cockpit set. With 70 planes ordered in the first few months after the certification, the fastest civilian turboprop twin (according to Flying Magazine) was rather successful. The add-on promises a faithful recreation of the Piaggio Avanti II. It will be available in the MSFS Marketplace for $24.99 next Thursday (06/02).Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. UK2000 Scenery recently released their rendition of the University of Illinois Willard Airport (KCMI), serving the Urbana metropolitan area, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.Â  While it was dedicated in late 1945, airline flights were to start nearly a decade later, in 1954, albeit in a very barebones manner, as the passenger terminal was only erected in 1960. By the late 1960s, Willard was the second-busiest airport in the state. However, it crumbled within a decade after the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Airlines found service to smaller airports inefficient and expensive. Airfares went up, whereas they went down at bigger airports like Chicago OâHare, quickly killing the demand and leading many airlines to leave the airport altogether. A new passenger terminal was built in the late 1980s and remains used today. Until eleven years ago, the airport was home to the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation, which was voted by trustees to be closed in 2011, and everything was transferred over to Parkland College in 2013 so that the enrolled students could complete their courses.Â  Parkland College still operates the airport, providing an annual subsidy of $433,000. Itâs currently served by a single airline, American Eagle, which flies passengers to Chicago OâHare and Dallas/Fort Worth.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with full-detail buildings, realistic ground markings, performance-friendly optimization, custom vegetation, PBR materials, custom static aircraft, custom night lighting, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.84, requiring at least 70.42 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>IM Scenery Releases RAF Honington for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. IM Scenery recently released their rendition of RAF Honington (EGXH), a Royal Air Force station in Suffolk, England, for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024.Â  Construction started in 1935 and was undertaken by John Laing &amp; Son, an investment group now known as John Laing Group, which boasts 177 years of history. The opening occurred two years later, nearly right in time for the beginning of World War 2. Based in Honington at the start of the war, the IX Squadron ran the first British bombing raid of the Second World War, attacking the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic. In 1942, the airfield was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces and upgraded to a class A Bomber base. It was eventually transferred back to the RAF once the war was over, primarily utilized by the RAF Transport Command and later by the RAF Bomber Command in 1949. In the 1950s, a 9,000 ft concrete runway was built and completed in 1956. In the 1980s, it was selected to become a base for the RAFâs Panavia Tornado fleet, with the IX Squadron being reformed there and becoming the worldâs first operational Tornado squadron. â In mid-1992, it was decided that Honington would become an RAF Regiment Depot, with the Tornado fleet wholly leaving the airport. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with fully custom objects with PBR textures, custom night lighting, custom ground poly, custom terraforming, and custom static aircraft. Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $8.30, requiring at least 712.1 MB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>
