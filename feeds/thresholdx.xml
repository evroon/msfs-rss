    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Barelli MSFS Addon recently released their version of Salerno Costa d'Amalfi Airport (LIRI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the Italian city of Salerno and has been closed for several years due to renovations and upgrades. It is scheduled to reopen in July 2024. The new scenery package from Barelli MSFS Addon features both a 2024 and a proposed 2026 version of Salerno Airport. The Salerno airport was established in 1926 by Italy's Air Force, primarily for flight training. Over the years, the airport underwent several upgrades. However, it wasn't until 2007 that it received check-in desks, boarding areas, luggage belts, and waiting rooms, allowing it to accommodate commercial traffic. In 2011, a project for the airport's further extension and new infrastructure was revealed, leading to its closure in 2016 for construction purposes. After a lengthy period of closure, the airport is set to reopen in July 2024. Airlines such as easyJet and Volotea have already planned numerous domestic and international destinations from Salerno. However, the airport will continue its construction until its completion in 2026. The new scenery package includes custom terminals, custom airport buildings, custom lighting, and much more. It offers two renditions of the airport, the current 2024 version, and the proposed 2026 version. Barelli MSFS Addon has stated that once the final changes for the airport are available, the scenery package will be updated accordingly. The add-on requires 227.11MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $13.86. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just a week after the v2 update for the 146 Professional, Just Flight published a development update for their upcoming RJ Professional, which is based on the Avro RJ, a modernized variant of BAe 146. â Thanks to similarities between 146 and RJ, the passenger cabins from 146 have been integrated into RJ and will include all cabin features that were present in the 146 Professional v2 update, along with small changes to reflect the difference in the RJ. One of the main differences between the two aircraft is the Flight Attendant panel, which has a switch for cabin lighting, as well as some different panels. Unfortunately, as of the posting of the development update, no screenshots of the cabin have been previewed. â Significant progress has been made in the RJ cockpit. Most of the systems that were semi-automated in 146 are now fully automated in RJ, such as the pressurization system. Even though the system couldâve been ported from 146, JF has decided to recode the whole system from the ground up.Â  â Along with the pressurization system, the development team has simulated the FADEC system as well. This system allowed all RJs to be fitted with auto-throttle, and also increased engine reliability and lowered fuel consumption. The modern GNLU-910A FMS will be integrated into RJ systems and will allow the implementation of LNAV and VNAV autopilot modes.Â  â Another area of development that is not being left out is liveries. Currently, over 30 high-quality liveries have been made, ranging from the very first operators of Avro RJ, all the way to present operators.Â  â Even though they have not shared any screenshots of the interior, lots of work has been done behind the scenes. Unfortunately, the release date is still not known, but, as always, Threshold will keep you updated with the progress of RJ Professional! â Stay tuned for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Fenix Simulations has recently released a new update to their A320 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, along with a quick delineation of their next steps, pricing for the upcoming expansion, and more. The newly released V2.0.0.407 brings angle of attack tweaks in flight control law, external engine performance optimizations, CTD mitigations, GSX integration issues, sound optimizations and fixes, a rework on the LOD (level of detail) system to fix FPS loss, many EFB fixes and improvements, and more. The complete changelog follows below: They are also happy to report that the A319/A321 package development is progressing nicely, and beta testing should begin âvery soon.â In celebratory fashion, the A320 is currently on sale for roughly $49.92 (the same price as the upcoming expansion) until 2200Z on Wednesday (17/04).Â  The aforementioned A320 base package includes the CFM and IAE variants of the Airbus A320 and their sharklet counterparts, albeit later in the year (after the release of the A319/A321 expansion). The upcoming expansion will, therefore, include the A319 and A321 with CFM and IAE engines and wingtip fences only at first, with sharklets to follow later in the year. It represents an average of $9.36 per variant! Based on customer feedback, their short-term plans include changes to the flare behavior and ground effect. While they wonât make significant alterations to keep the consistency at bay, they have identified areas where gentle adjustments can be made, especially regarding ground effect. Although satisfied with the lift/cushion effect, they feel like the drag addictive could be slightly increased, helping the aircraft âsettleâ on the runway a bit better.Â  While Microsoft Flight Simulatorâs lift and drag of the ground effect are intrinsically tied to one another, the developers found a way around it with a custom solution that would allow granular control over the drag properties when under said ground effect.Â  Complaints about controlling the aircraft when on the ground were also listened to and the ground friction modeling was re-tuned in accordance with SU15 and its new ground friction model.Â  Both ground effect and ground modeling tweaks are expected to be rolled out as soon as possible, with the upcoming expansion not being an obstacle whatsoever.Â  The add-on is available in theirÂ storeÂ for roughly $49.99 (until 17.04), under a 20% discount.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. NZA Simulations recently launched a new scenery package called NZTG - Tauranga Region for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The package includes Tauranga Airport (NZTG) as well as three other locations: Waihi Beach Aerodrome (NZWV), Motiti Island Airport (NZOI), and Tauranga Hospital Heliport (NZJA). Tauranga Airport is situated in Tauranga, New Zealand, and is the main airport serving the region, with an average of approximately 376,000 passengers in 2022. In 1935, the Tauranga Aero Club leased some land to establish an aerodrome in the Tauranga area. Due to growing demand, a permanent facility was required, and the aerodrome was converted into Tauranga Airport. The airport opened in 1939, but shortly after, the Royal New Zealand Air Force took control of it because of World War II. During this period, the airport underwent some upgrades, including runway extension and new hangars. In 1945, the airport was returned to the Tauranga Aero Club, and the first passenger flights were introduced the following year. The airport underwent several upgrades over the years, and today, it is the 8th busiest airport in New Zealand. Air New Zealand, Barrier Air, and Sunair are some of the airlines that operate from the airport, providing passengers with a broad range of destinations. The new scenery package features a precise depiction of Tauranga Airport (NZTG), Waihi Beach Aerodrome (NZWV), Motiti Island Airport (NZOI), and Tauranga Hospital Heliport (NZJA). The package also comes with custom 3D modeled objects, 3D interiors, animations, custom lighting, and numerous other features. The add-on requires approximately 1.58GB of storage space and is available on NZA Simulations' website for around $20.20. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released a new add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator, called Aerosoft Mt. Everest Airport Vol. 1 - Lukla. The add-on includes the renowned Tenzing-Hillary Airport (VNLK), also known as Lukla Airport. The airport of Lukla has gained notoriety for its challenging and risky approach and takeoff procedures. It is located in Nepal, surrounded by mountains, and has a runway length of only 1729 ft (527 m). Despite its short runway, the airport can still accommodate up to 150,000 passengers annually. Lukla Airport was constructed in 1964, after the original plan to build the airport on flat farmland was abandoned due to local farmers' unwillingness to give up their land. Instead, the airport was built at its current location, and Sir Edmund Hillary oversaw the construction process. He purchased the land from local Sherpas, but was dissatisfied with the soil resistance of the runway. It wasn't until 2001 that the runway was paved. In 2008, the airport was renamed Tenzing-Hillary Airport in honor of Sherpa Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. Today, the airport is operated by several airlines, providing flights from destinations such as Kathmandu, Manthali, and Phaplu, and has become increasingly well-known. The newly released rendition of Lukla Airport features detailed 3D terrain model of Lukla Airport, high-resolution photorealistic textures, Lukla Helipad, detailed terminal building with interior, animated people and animals, realistic night lighting, and more. The add-on requires approximately 4GB of storage space and is available on Aerosoft for around $8.90. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently issued a major update to their rendition of Dunedin Airport (NZDN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, including improvements, bug fixes, further optimization, and more. Built in 1962 to replace a nearby airfield (Taieri Airfield) deemed not economically feasible to expand for the expected air travel demand, Dunedin was idealized for short-haul aircraft services. NZNAC was one of the first airlines to serve the airport with its fleet of Fokker Friendships and Vickers Viscounts.  The airport first underwent upgrades in the late 1960s and 1970s, with the inclusion of automatic sliding doors in 1969 and a toilet expansion in 1971. Three years later, it also got a new mezzanine floor and an aircraft viewing deck.  It was upgraded again in 1988 when the administration built airline lounges and airbridges to accommodate Ansett New Zealand's Boeing 737 operations (later replaced by BAe 146s). A runway extension followed soon after in 1993, bringing it to its current length of 1,900 meters. A new terminal building was inaugurated in October 2005, considerably increasing its passenger handling capabilities. It's served by Air New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington) and Jetstar (Auckland), averaging around 1 million passengers per year. Update 1.1 brings a vast list of changes to their rendition, including new hangars (entirely redone), a new ATC tower, LODs on terminal and hangars for extra performance, night lighting improvements, improved jetway docking, texture optimizations, and more. The complete changelog follows below: â âIt's available on the iniBuilds Store for roughly $7.67, requiring at least 4.05 GB of free hard disk space to install.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A new local legend has been released by the Microsoft Flight Simulator team. It's the Dornier Do 31, an interesting-looking VTOL experimental military aircraft made by West Germany in the late 1960s. The development of this distinctive aircraft was driven by German interest in Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing Aircraft (STOVL) aircraft. In addition to test flights, the aircraft was present at the Paris Air Show in 1969. A total of five world records were broken during its short service from 1967 to 1970). Most of those records were broken during the ferry flight to Paris. The plane was one of a kind since no one had ever tried to produce or design a similar aircraft. Unfortunately, due to the high operating costs, the Do 31 project was canceled in April 1970. Although the plane did not live for long, it was still an engineering masterpiece featuring a hybrid digital-analog supercomputer, the Do-960. The supercomputer collected all inputs from the pilot and converted them into thrust controls. Even after the project was abandoned, the computer was implemented all around the world, due to its amazing performance. With a service ceiling of 35.100 feet, a maximum speed of 393kt (730km/h, 452mph), and a range of 1800 km (1200 mi) the newly released plane comes with seven liveries: 1 Experimental, E3 Experimental, Olive Green, Green Camouflage, Marine Search &amp; Rescue, Xbox Aviators Club, and Aviators Club. The newly released plane is now available on the in-Sim Marketplace for $14.99 and takes up 7.66GB of disk space when installed. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

The Airbus A330 is one of the best-selling long-haul aircraft with over 1.600 built. This makes it the second most-produced wide-body aircraft after the B777. There are a multitude of variants of the plane, with the most popular ones being A330-300, A330-200, and A330-900neo. This will be ToLissâ second wide-body addon and fifth Airbus addon. Being known for having great systems and modeling, ToLiss is often known as one of the best addon developers of X-Plane. Although we know that the new project is about the A330, the specific variant, release date, and features are still unknown. â As always, Threshold will keep you updated on this project!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. HiFi Simulation Technologies has just announced a long-awaited product for Microsoft Flight Simulator, Active Sky FS. Active Sky FS will come with tons of features ranging from direct MSFS integration to enhanced cloudscapes and the famous Active Sky Weather Engine. ASFS will feature two weather depiction modes, passive and preset weather. Passive weather depiction uses MSFS live weather data, allowing MSFS to take full control of weather depiction. At the same time, ASFS provides active air effects and other features, such as mapping, planning, voice features, condition reports, companion app, and more. Passive depiction is recommended for VFR flying, as it provides better cloud variation. When it comes to preset weather depiction mode, it contains weather condition controls for the best accuracy. It allows for full use of Active Sky weather data features, including real-time, historical, and custom weather options. This mode is recommended for those desiring realism in flight simulators. Active air effects will enhance the simulator with lots of different features, including clear air turbulence, broken and overcast cloud layer turbulence, internal MSFS turbulence compatibility, updrafts, downdrafts, microbursts, thunderstorm effect, gusts, wind variation, gust-related turbulence, and many more. Although ASFS's pricing is not yet determined, it is currently in beta testing and has gotten the status of releasing soon. Support for FS2024 is also planned without an additional fee unless there will be any major re-designs. The release date is currently unknown, but Threshold will keep you updated as always! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has recently released LaGuardia Airport (KLGA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which has been highly anticipated by the community. Located just 8 miles away from Midtown Manhattan, LaGuardia is the third busiest airport in New York. In 2023, the airport managed an impressive 369,393 aircraft operations and served just over 32,370,000 passengers, making it the twentieth busiest airport in the United States. LaGuardia Airport was opened in 1939 and has undergone multiple name changes over the years. It started as Glenn H. Curtiss Airport, then became North Beach Airport, and was later renamed New York Municipal Airport-LaGuardia Field after being redesigned by the city of New York. In 1953, the airport was finally named LaGuardia Airport after Fiorello La Guardia, the former New York mayor. Over the years, the airport has seen many upgrades and improvements. In 2024, it won the Airport Service Quality Award and now serves a wide range of destinations with multiple airlines, including Delta, American, JetBlue, and more. The recently released version of LaGuardia Airport features a highly accurate rendition of LaGuardia KLGA, detailed terminal interiors, VDGS, handcrafted 3D models, custom satellite imagery, elevation data, realistic lighting, and more. The add-on requires a total of 1.93GB of storage space and is available on Contrail for roughly $16.17. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
