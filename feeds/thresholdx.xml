    <summary>Sim: OTHER. After many months of uncertainty, and with questions still swirling about the status of the company as a whole, Honeycomb Aeronauticalâs highly anticipated Charlie Rudder Pedals have gone into production today and will finally ship to customers starting in August, according to a statement from Aerosoft. Early this year, Honeycomb fell into hot water as many months of radio silence led to a statement by the companyâs CEO, Nicki Repenning, admitting that they were struggling financially, and that his former business partner and CEO of Snakebyte-group, Mike Steup, hid this information from him and stole pre-order money set aside for the Charlie Rudder Pedal production had âgone elsewhere.â Snakebyte and Mr. Steup denies these allegations. Threshold interviewed Mr. Repenning as a culmination of a weeks-long initial investigation, which you can read here.  According to Aerosoft, production of the pedals has started today and they have been able to âtest the pre-production models extensively,â and they are âimpressed by the quality of the materials and the realistic feel of the pedals.â Aerosoft plans to start deliveries on August 29th. As a compensation for the long waiting time, all customers who have pre-ordered the Charlie Pedals via the Aerosoft Shop or have already pre-ordered them will receive an Aerosoft Shop voucher worth 30â¬ ($32.17USD). Aerosoft also says that those who are attending this weekendâs FlightSimExpo in Las Vegas can try out the Charlie Pedals at their booth. As a special promotion for the UEFA European Championship, New customers can get a Honeycomb Alpha Yoke at a discounted price of 199.99â¬ ($214.43USD), for as long as the German national team is in the tournament. The Charlie Pedals can now be pre-ordered on the Aerosoft Shop for 369.99â¬ ($396.70USD).  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: DCS. Eagle Dynamics has recently previewed an update to the Flaming Cliffs franchise.Â  Flaming Cliffs is a pack of less-detailed aircraft made for players who prefer a straightforward experience, without complex systems. Some of the well-known FC aircraft are MiG-29, A-10A, and Su-27. The FC2024 update will include three planes: F-5E, F-86F and MiG-15bis.Â  F-5E is an exceptionally capable aircraft for air combat and unguided ground strikes. Equipped with âSidewindersâ and cannons for dogfights, the F-5E also has a BVR (beyond visual range) radar. F-86F was one of the best fighter jets during the Korean War.Â  Armed with 50-calibre machine guns for dogfighting and early infrared-guided air-to-air missiles. Aside from Air-to-Air, F-86F can also be equipped with unguided bombs and rockets for air-to-ground attacks. MiG-15bis was also one of the most revolutionary fighters, also one of the best fighters in the Korean War. It was unrivalled and would outmatch every aircraft in a dogfight until the F-86F Sabre came. Small and light plane, but a tough fighter. Its armament included two 23mm guns and a 37mm cannon. Existing Flaming Cliffs 3 owners can upgrade to the new update for $9.99 until the end of July when the upgrade fee will increase to $14.99. F-5E, F-86F and MiG-15bis can also be individually purchased for $14.99 each.Â  The exact release date is unknown, however, we know for a fact that it will come with the new DCS update. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news! â â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MK Studios has just released their rendition of Keflavik International Airport for MSFS. Serving the Greater Reykjavik Area, Keflavik International Airport has more than 7,500,000 passenger operations and more than 75,000 aircraft movements yearly. Built by the United States Military during WWII, the airport served as a replacement for British airfields in the northern part of Iceland. It consisted of two separate runways built 4km apart. After the war, the Meeks Field was renamed to Naval Air Station Keflavik, and in 1951, the US military returned to the airport. After the military air base in Keflavik was reestablished, passengers had to pass several military checkpoints before boarding the aircraft until 1987, when the separate civilian terminal was built. Two 10,000ft (3,000m) long runways are 200ft (60m) wide, which is enough to accommodate AN-225 and even a NASA Space Shuttle. This airport is also an important alternative in case of emergency during trans-Atlantic flights. Despite the low population of Iceland, it is a popular destination among travellers from both Europe and North America. Keflavik International Airport is a hub of two airlines: Icelandair - the flag carrier of Iceland, and PLAY - a low-cost airline. It also serves 25 airlines that fly to more than 80 destinations in the USA and Europe, as well as more than 35 seasonal destinations, mostly in Europe. Aside from passenger airlines, Icelandair Cargo flies to Boston, Liege and Los Angeles from Keflavik. MK Studios rendition of the airport features a detailed rendition of Keflavik Airport (BIKF) and Reykjavik Airport (BIRK), the up-to-date layout of the airport, custom jetways and vehicle models, modelled terminal interior, custom runway and taxiway lights and custom taxiway markings. This scenery is available for purchase on the IniBuilds store for roughly $18.98, but for the first 7 days after release, there will be a 5% discount ($18.08). It will also require at least 1.93GB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews! â</summary>
