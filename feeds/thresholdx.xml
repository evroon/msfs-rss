    <title>Fenix Announces A320NEO family for Microsoft Flight Simulator</title>
    <updated>2025-03-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/fx320n"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67e6e1610162be660eaedf2e_neo-leap-hero.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix has just posted its 2025 roadmap, detailing planned updates for the current A320 CEO family, compatibility improvements for MSFS 2024, and a new NEO variant. A320 and A321 NEO Announcement The major highlight of the roadmap is the announcement of an all-new A320 and A321 NEO. After extensive research and development, Fenix has created a completely new âNEOâ standard ECAM system from the ground up, which is independent of ProSim. This advancement allows for even deeper system modeling. This is not merely an updated A320 CEO with new engines; it is a fully developed A320 NEO simulation. According to Fenix, the entire aircraft has been rewired, encompassing every sensor and generator. They have also developed a fully functional DRAIMS panel, although visuals are not yet available for display. Both the CFM LEAP engine and the Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan will be fully represented in the simulation. Additionally, the Fenix A320 NEO will be a standalone product, meaning that prior ownership of the A320 CEO family is not a requirement. Upcoming Big Fenix Update Fenix has announced that a major update for the A320 CEO family will be released in a couple of weeks. This update will include the addition of A139 sharklets, the implementation of the Weather Radar, and new landing dynamics that enhance flare and ground effect behavior. Several upgrades to the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) will also be introduced, such as support for Lido charts and a improvedV-Speeds calculations. Additionally, there will be audio improvements, including a new 3D AEVC soundscape for the flight deck and a redesigned IAAE V2500 soundset. Fenix says they will provide a full changelog shortly. â For more details on the Fenix A320 NEO and A321 NEO, along with the upcoming big Fenix update, refer to Fenixâs website. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon â</summary>

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.2.0 Update</title>
    <updated>2025-04-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xp1222"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67ef0ee9572b607093dd0c18_lgt1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released a major update to X-Plane 12, which brings massive improvements to cloud rendering, lighting, environmental effects, and graphics performance. Their graphics team has been working to mitigate the famed dark cockpit issue, bringing significantly improved interior rendering quality. The light coming into the cockpit correctly follows the aircraft's contours and structural details. Furthermore, the graphics engine's exposure handling has also been improved, bringing exposure fusionâa familiar feature on most modern smartphonesâto the virtual realm of X-Plane 12. It consists of taking multiple photos at various levels of exposure and then automatically stitching them together, yielding a potentially impressive-looking result.Â  The sky brightness has also been tweaked to ensure it's more natural and doesn't burn people's retinas. Ground object brightness values have also been tweaked to ensure they are not overly bright. Their graphics engine as a whole has also undergone changes, with an upgrade to their shader compiler, which manages resources more efficiently and thus brings smoother performance figures. Texture handling has also been tweaked to ensure faster loading times and more efficient rendering. Their VRAM management method has also been tweaked, ensuring it prioritizes smaller memory requests before large ones, aiding total memory allocation. Additionally, it makes multiple attempts to allocate memory before giving up, allowing the system to free up space when needed and ultimately reduce the chances of blurry textures or slow performance overall. The cloud rendering system has also been changed, with a small radius surrounding the camera's viewport sporting high-quality clouds, nearly eliminating cloud pixelation effects around the airplane. They hint at it being a stepping stone to other cool rendering effects in the future. Last but not least, they have also changed how their light rendering system works by breaking them into tiles, yielding better performance in demanding environments such as large airports and cities. In addition, they have also made minor changes to colors, bringing more realistic color accuracy, improved sky rendering, better cloud shadows, cloud shadows on clouds, cloud-aware ambient light, and more realistic shadows overall. Detail has also been enhanced on surface textures around airports, and weather effects now also show outside of the airport's area, accumulating on main roads, as suggested by the community. â The complete changelog follows below: â Known Issues â Fixes and Enhancements General â Graphics â â Scenery â The update is currently available on the public_beta branch on Steam. Laminar customers can get the update by toggling âCheck for new betas as well as updatesâ.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. Imaginesim has just released its version of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (KDFW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It is the third busiest airport in the world in terms of passenger traffic and aircraft movements. Last year, nearly 88 million passengers travelled through the airport. Planning for the airport began in 1927, but the plans underwent numerous revisions over the years, delaying construction until 1969. After several years of discussions, planning, and construction, the airport finally opened in 1974. At the time of its opening, it was the largest airport in the world by land area. Since then, the airport has experienced significant growth in traffic, and various expansion projects are currently underway or planned for the future. Today, the airport serves a variety of airlines, accommodating nearly 88 million passengers annually through just over 743,000 aircraft movements. The scenery package includes a variety of features, such as highly detailed terminals, high-definition texturing, custom SafeGateâ¢ Visual Docking Guidance, and custom jetways, among many others. A version for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is also in development, and it will be available as a free upgrade for current owners. Additionally, animations for the Skylink train are in progress. The newly released Dallas Fort Worth International Airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 is now available from Imaginesim for approximately $32.64. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>PMDG Unveils Operations Center 3.0</title>
    <updated>2025-04-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pmdoc3"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/67536d0cda476a2b5d5c3f25_frei5.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS20. PMDG recently unveiled its new Operations Center 3.0, a complete overhaul of their product management application, which has been roughly the same since 2017. The new application features a fresh design, additional diagnostic tools, in-software add-on installation, streamlined livery handling, and much more. The rollout from OC2 to OC3 will be gradual, with the 777F being the first product to transition to the new suite. People who might be interested in checking the new Operations Center are instructed to uninstall their 777F, download OC3 from here, install it, enter their PMDG credentials, and then install the 777F from there. The 777-300ER will follow shortly (within the next few days), and once it is available, the procedure is expected to be the same as the one listed above. â PMDG will also provide full documentation on operating the new Operations Center, which is said to be available âin time for the weekend.â â As they move their entire product line to OC3, installers will no longer be available once the rollout is complete, as they want people managing their product line straight from OC3. â They also hint at making a new 777 available soon, with âmore news on that on the next update.â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. PMDG has recently released another development update regarding nearly all of its products for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Key highlights from the update include the announcement of a release window for the upcoming PMDG 777-200ER for both MSFS 2020 and 2024, as well as a rollout sequence for the product line tailored for MSFS 2024. The development team has announced that the 777-200ER will be released simultaneously for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024, with the launch expected between April 16th and April 29th. The add-on will feature different engine types, including the GE90-92 and the Rolls Royce Trent 892. Additionally, it will include a new generation of sound packages. There will be only one package available, which will include versions for both simulators. With the release of the first PMDG product for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 approaching, the team has announced a rollout schedule for their product lineup. The expected release dates are as follows:Â  â - The 777-200ER is anticipated between April 16th and April 29th. - The DC-6 is scheduled for early May. - The 777F and 777-300ER are expected to be released between mid and late May. - The 777-200LR will be available from late May to early June. - The 737NGs do not yet have an estimated arrival time, as their conversion to 2024 has not yet begun. The team has announced that the 747 product lines will only be developed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and not for 2020. Additionally, the PMDG Operations Center 3 has been expanded to include the 777F and 777-300ER. The DC-6 and all 737NG variants will be added very soon. Once these aircraft are added to OC3, they will be removed from OC2.
