    <summary>Sim: FS24. Fenix Simulations today released the longâanticipated, aptly nicknamed âBig Fenix Updateâ, a sweeping overhaul of the entire A320 family, for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update delivers full MSFS 2024 support, major flight-model enhancements, and a range of system, livery, art, and EFB improvements. The update introduces full FS2024ânative modular SimObject support and rendering updates, along with new engine models, as well as the new A319 Sharklet variant, with custom performance data. The flight deck has been remodelled and retextured for MSFS 2024, complete with reworked display rendering, new soundsets, and a revamped livery manager featuring dozens of new liveries. Landing dynamics and flyâbyâwire responsiveness have been retuned, with ground law, elevator deflection, AoA protection and Î±MAX handling improved across all variants. Flex temp unlatching logic, OP CLB/DES behaviour, and Flight Director pitch response in normal flight have all been refined. Performance has also been improved through reduced CPU load and optimised display rendering. A new LOD-system has also been implemented for all models, bringing further optimization. Flight model enhancements focus on improved groundâlaw behaviour, AoA protection, and refined handling characteristics across all variants. Autopilot pitch response, flex temp logic, and Open Climb/Descent behaviour have also been reworked. Furthermore, Wingflex has also seen further improvement. The update introduces full support for MSFS 2024âs walkaround mode, with interactive cargo doors, chocks, power panels, engine fanblades and refuelling controls. Automatic connection of stairs and door opening on spawn-in has been added. New configuration options in the EFB allow control over ADIRS type, ACP style and ISIS display preferences. The update also brings support for the MSFS weather-radar, which is now fully implemented, within simulator limitations. Furthermore, the update includes various visual upgrades such as new cabin lighting, a new native iridescent windshield material, microscratches and refined glass decals for MSFS 2024. New sounds have been added to doors, cooling fans and avionics contactors, amongst others. A completely new IAE engine sound set is also included, with windmilling effects.Â  Walkaround mode now supports insideâoutside sound transitions and even avatar walking noises, though collisions may still cause occasional jitter. A brandânew native EFB chart app is featured, with LIDO support and an option to switch between simulator and Navigraph sources. Pilot Brief PDF viewing, custom refuelling rates, takeâoff performance tools with ACT count, chart annotations and automatic switching of weight units when importing from SimBrief are included.Â The EFB also now works in walkaround-mode.  For a further deep dive into flight model and flyâbyâwire behaviour, an unlisted video on Fenixâs official YouTube channel offers detailed insight into control input processing and control surface responses.  You can watch it here.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. FSLabs recently issued a new experimental update to their A321ceo and ceo for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The update focuses on increasing stability, improving visual performance, and improving the braking distance, among other things. Update v11.0.1.310 is a small interim update that brings further improvements to performance, improves stability by mitigating a problem with the TCAS that causes CTDs, and fixes a typographical error in the aircraft.cfg that would allow the plane to be used as AI traffic, hindering performance. They have also made further tweaks to the handling, fine-tuned the autobrake distance, and prevented the brakes from âgrabbingâ on touchdown under some specific circumstances. Furthermore, the update also extends compatibility with hardware such as overheads, pedestals, and more that can be used with Mobiflight. â The complete changelog follows below: FMGC: BSCU: Systems Improvements: The developers have also announced they will improve the thrust and drag models for the LEAP engines. They will bring a more accurate thrust output across altitude and mach ranges and refined drag behavior to better reflect real-world figures in terms of overall performance and fuel burn. These improvements are based on deeper performance data analysis and internal validation work they have been doing for the past couple of weeks. The new changes are expected to roll out in an interim update next week. The A321ceo and neo are available in their store for $69.95 each.

    <title>Pyreegue Dev Co. Releases Birmingham Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>
    <updated>2025-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/pyrebhx2024"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/688cb3c6813a386cef7a159b_bhx1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: FS24. Pyreegue Dev Co. has recently released their rendition of Birmingham Airport (EGBB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the West Midlands in the United Kingdom and has a yearly average of 12.8 million passengers, making it the seventh busiest in the Country. The idea for an airport in Birmingham was first conceived in 1928, and a committee was created shortly after to research possible locations to start building. After much deliberation, Elmdon was deemed the best of the bunch, but the project soon went back to the drawing board due to the Great Depression. It wasnât until 1933 that works resumed, with a new committee formed to oversee its construction. Before taking any steps, though, the newly formed committee went on a research trip to multiple successful airports in Europe, such as Schiphol (Amsterdam), Berlin (Tempelhof), Paris (Orly), Brussels, and London.Â  By January 1935, they had finally approached a companyâNorman and Dawbarnâto advise on the construction and help design the airport as lead architects. Groundwork started in 1936, after the government allowed the airportâs development. â A year later, in 1937, Norman and Dawbarn were authorized to begin drawing the airportâs project, the undertaking of which took 6 months to reach completion. It was not until October 1937 that the construction of the airportâs buildings would start, costing around 360,000 pounds. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain opened the airport in July 1939 as Elmdon Airport. The terminal featured a modern (for late 30s standards) art deco design with an integrated control tower and was the airportâs main terminal until 1984.Â  â The airport was requisitioned by the Air Ministry to be used by both the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy as RAF Elmdon during World War 2. The military âoccupationâ replaced the original grass runways with two hard runways, 753 meters in length and 1,271 meters in length, respectively.Â  It was used as a testbed for Avro Lancasters and Stirling bombers manufactured in northeast Worcestershire. These bombers were transported via land to Elmdon because their local airport didnât have a long enough runway. â On July 8, 1946, the airport, which was celebrating its 7th anniversary, was reopened for civilian use, albeit still government-controlled. â Scheduled services started in 1949 with British European Airways, flying passengers to Paris. Over the years, the airline eventually expanded its network to ZÃ¼rich, DÃ¼sseldorf, Palma, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. In the early 1960s, they built a new terminal to handle international traffic and extended the main runway to 2.2 km, allowing the airport to handle larger turboprop aircraft and jetliners. â By the beginning of the 1970s, Birmingham Airport was already reaching a million passengers per year, significantly congesting their subpar terminal infrastructure. In the 1980s, BHX became home to the worldâs first commercial maglev system, a train levitated by magnets. This system ran for nearly 10 years but eventually faced discontinuation due to unreliability. It was replaced by a cable-hauled system in 2003. â In late 2007, the airportâs administration devised a development plan for Birmingham called âTowards 2030: Planning a Sustainable Future for Air Transport in the Midlands.â The plan included changes to the terminals, alterations to the airfield layout, and infrastructure improvements. Unexpectedly, environmentalists and locals complained, as they didnât want the construction of a second parallel runway.Â  The original planânow canceledâcould have created up to 250,000 jobs in the area, made the airport handle up to 70 million passengers annually, and led to around 500,000 aircraft movements in total. â In 2008, the shorter runway (06/24) was decommissioned due to its length and noise impact. Instead, it became a taxiway, allowing the expansion of the apron.Â  â Construction work on the new 3-storey International Pier kicked off in June of that same year, taking a bit more than a year to complete. Now, Birmingham Airport was fully compatible with the Airbus A380, which visited the airport during its 70th birthday. It was the first commercial service of the A380 in the United Kingdom that was not bound to London Heathrow. â In 2010, it was announced that they would merge Terminal 1 and 2 into a single building and change the name from Birmingham International Airport to Birmingham Airport. They figured this could help create a new corporate identity that would better reflect their current position in the market and attract more people to fly from it. Research showed that while 8 million people lived within an hour of the airport, only 40% of them used it.Â  â A new control tower was built in 2011, ultimately replacing the original one built in 1939. The plans for extending the main runway, originally submitted in 2008, were approved a year later, but the work was only completed in 2014, two years after their original target, which was the 2012 London Olympics.Â  â In late 2016, 100 million pounds were invested in building a new baggage handling system and two new car parks. â Itâs an operating base for easyJet, Jet2, Ryanair, and TUI Airways, and served by Aer Lingus, Air France, Air India, Aurigny, Brussels Airlines, Corendon Airlines, Emirates, Eurowings, KLM, Loganair, Lufthansa, Pegasus Airlines, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Scandinavian Airlines, SunExpress, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, Vueling, and WizzAir. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date layout representing its finished status in 2026, 25,000 square meters of explorable interiors (2024-only), custom terraforming, animated people, a custom GSX profile, an animated monorail, and much more. â Itâs available on Contrail for roughly $22.78, requiring at least 3.42 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds recently announced their intent to develop a rendition of Manchester International Airport (EGCC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, the third busiest airport in the United Kingdom with a yearly average of 23.3 million passengers. â Construction work began in 1935, and the airport was partially operating by 1937 (the official conclusion happened a year later). KLM was the first airline to launch scheduled commercial flights to the newly opened airport in 1938. â It was converted into an RAF base during WW2 and played an essential role in military aircraft production and parachutist training. â The post-war period saw its return as a commercial airport, with rapid growth during the 50s and 60s, where it eventually managed to be Britain's second busiest airport after London Heathrow. â The airport was heavily expanded in the 1980s and 90s to keep up with the exponential growth figures, eventually leading to the millionth passenger in a month mark in 1987. Plans for a new terminal were put in place, and Princess Diana opened it as Terminal A in 1989.Â  â From 1997 to 2001, a second runway was built, leading to many protests from locals because natural habitats were disturbed and listed buildings had to be demolished, but they didn't have another option. â New expansion work started in 2019 to keep up with the ever-growing passenger traffic figures. â EasyJet, Jet2.com, Ryanair, and TUI Airways have operating bases in Manchester. Many airlines from around the Globe serve it, including Air Canada, Air France, Brussels Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Etihad, Finnair, KLM, Kuwait Airways, Lufthansa, Qatar, Scandinavian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Turkish, Virgin Atlantic, and more. â iniBuilds says they are heading back to the UK as British sceneries have been reaching new heights as of late, and they also want to be a part of it, delivering an accurate rendition of Manchester. â Currently, they are looking for locals who happen to work at the airport to help them with data so they can craft an exquisite rendition of the airport. If you fit the bill, reach out to management@inibuilds.com. â There's no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed. Stay tuned!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iniBuilds has recently provided an exciting update on aircraft development in their forum, announcing the official launch of the Airbus A340, which was teased earlier this summer. The A340 model in question is the A340-313 variant, powered by four CFM56-5C4 engines. IniBuilds says that the aircraft will feature a diverse selection of real-world liveries, custom cabins, a comprehensive failure system, and complete EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) integration. Additionally, IniBuilds is collaborating with Echo19 Audio to enhance the audio experience. Three variants will be included in one purchase: the passenger variant, the ACJ variant (luxury configuration), and the passenger-to-freighter converted variant. IniBuilds states that they intend to release it simultaneously on both PC and Xbox, while also confirming that the aircraft will be exclusive to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The development update primarily focused on A340, but we also received information that the A380 is very much still in active development and is making steady progress in the background.Â  â Additionally, work is ongoing on the A350, which had its initial release earlier this year. iniBuilds is continuing to resolve bugs and making progress towards an Xbox release on Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. â For more details on the A340 and other iniBuilds news, check out their development update here. â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon â</summary>

The product includes three major variants of the MH-60 family, also accompanied by the new âMission Hubâ platform. The MH-60 is a multi-role, maritime helicopter designed for operations such as search and rescue, anti-submarine warfare, medevac, and special operations support. The release features the MH-60R, MH-60S, and MH-60T variants, with a total of 39 liveries, representing a range of real-world operators. The helicopterâs systems are modelled in detail, including a customised autopilot and stability augmentation functions, semi-functional weapons, and mission equipment, such as sling loads and acoustic elements. Blackbird Simulations contributed the 3D modelling for the package, which includes a highly detailed cockpit, functional displays, and mission-specific systems. The soundscape was produced by Echo19, using actual recordings of the GE T700-GE-401 engine. The package also includes four mini-scenery areas for mission execution, including CGAS San Diego, CGAS Kodiak, Garden Island in Australia, and PeÃ±Ã³n de VÃ©lez de la Gomera in Spain. The Mission Hub, released alongside the MH-60, provides a mission and campaign system, adding multiple objective types, dynamic triggers, and an in-sim editor. Missions can be created using a modular system and executed with any aircraft. Pre-built missions are available for immediate use with the MH-60, and new mission content is planned for future updates. The full feature list of the Miltech Simulations MH-60 follows below: Ultra-Detailed 3D ModelHand-crafted with high-resolution detail, based on real-world survey imagery and references. Three Variants, 39 LiveriesIncludes the MH-60S (Sierra), MH-60R (Romeo), and MH-60T (Tango) models, each with their own role-specific equipment and liveries. Custom Flight Model and Stability SystemsRealistic flight dynamics validated by MH-60 pilots. Includes a fully custom AFCS and SAS, supporting all documented autopilot modes. The MH-60 is priced at $37.99, and the Mission Hub at a standalone price or discounted bundle when purchased together.
