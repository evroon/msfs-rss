    <title>SHADESCENE Releases Tawau Airport for MSFS 2020/2024</title>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. SHADESCENE has recently released their rendition of Tawau Airport (WBKW) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. The airport serves the Tawau Division in Malaysia and has a yearly average of 572,365 passengers. The airport was inaugurated in December 2001, replacing Tawauâs former main airport. It was small and tricky due to its very short runway (one of the shortest in Malaysia), which caused great concern overall.Â  The official inauguration only happened two years later, in 2003.Â  Its passenger terminal has one and a half stories, with two jetways and the ability to accommodate up to 8 airplanes simultaneously. â Before COVID-19, the airport was operating above maximum capacity, reaching 1.8 million passengers yearly, significantly exceeding its intended 1.4 million passenger capacity. A plan was made to expand it to 2.5 million passengers and upgrade the passenger facilities and overall infrastructure. COVID put a halt to the expansion plans, and in 2022, they were still facing the same issue, constantly suffering from congestion. â In 2023, the government allocated a substantial sum for an improvement program, including extra toilets, an enhanced check-in area, an expanded departure lounge, more retail spaces, and more air conditioning units. A year later, a new plan was announced, encompassing a major expansion set to begin in 2025. The expansion will bring the main terminal from 15,800 square meters to 23,500, add eight new check-in counters, and more. The new capacity would remain aligned with the previous project at 2.5 million passengers annually. â AirAsia, Batik Air Malaysia, Firefly, Malaysia Airlines, and MASwings serve it. â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom terraforming, custom scenery objects, custom ground textures, custom night lighting, and more. â Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $14.02, requiring at least 345.46 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Aerosoft has just released an update for Mega Airport Frankfurt for both Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. While the changelog is brief, this update introduces optimisations that significantly decrease VRAM usage and enhance overall performance. The latest update introduces optimisations for all models, textures, LOD settings, and more. This has allowed for a reduction in VRAM usage of up to 1.6 GB, though most users can expect a slightly smaller decrease. Some users reported performance drops when facing Terminal 2. This issue was caused by the large forest north of the terminal, but it has now been resolved. The team has noted a bug with blurry textures in the scenery, and they are currently working on a patch that is expected to be released by early next week. The updated version of Mega Airport Frankfurt is now available at Aerosoft on sale for $18.41. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>

    <title>iFly Outlines Future Plans, Confirms MSFS 2024 Focus and MAX 9</title>
    <updated>2025-08-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: FS24. iFly has via Discord released an official development update for its 737 MAX product, outlining planned features for the Service Pack 1 update, as well as its plans for the MSFS 2024 platform. The team made it clear that the SP1 content is still in active development, and that the update will not be released within the next three months. Amongst the changes in SP1 are a more âtablet-styleâ electronic flight bag (EFB), rather than the current Boeing OEM unit, accompanied by CPDLC integration via the Hoppie API, with support for online networks, as well as BATC and SayIntentions, also under review. Other planned features include cabin announcements (with and without GSX), the MAX 8-200 variant, with the typeâs Mid-Cabin Emergency Doors modelled, a visual APU model, an expanded main wheel well model, and an updated fuselage model, rivets and other details.  Cabin materials will be redrawn with more texture detail, multiple seating layouts will be offered, and cockpit materials will be refined for better surface type distinction. Landing gear textures will be overhauled, LNAV behaviour will see targeted adjustments, and numerous smaller fixes will be implemented before release. The update also marks a shift in development priorities. SP1 will be the final major release to support MSFS 2020, with all future development moving to MSFS 2024, due to substantial platform differences between the two. Post-SP1 plans include a native MSFS 2024 version of the MAX 9, with the MAX 10 and MAX 7 also under consideration, only after official certification and service entry of those types. While small patches may still arrive for the current MAX 8 for 2020 after SP1, iFlyâs primary focus will be advancing the series for the newer simulator.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Orbx has shared an update of its highly anticipated HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport (KATL) for MSFS 2020 and 2024. The update was posted on its community forum earlier this week. Developed by Matteo Veneziani, this is the third and final planned preview before release. The previews highlight the Delta TechOps area and the airportâs control tower, amongst others. Delta TechOps, also known as Delta TOC, is the largest airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility in North America, and has been recreated in the scenery, with 1:1 accuracy. Veneziani stated that âevery pipe, air-conditioning unit, and rooftop elementâ was individually modelled, based on real-world references. While the developer showcased the maintenance complex, he noted that the airside portion of the airport is not yet ready for display, as the ground polygon is still in progress. Remaining work includes cargo buildings on both the north and south sides, taxiway signage, approach lighting, and tunnel detailing, as well as general finishing touches. According to Veneziani, the goal is to release the scenery before Christmas. He noted that development has been underway for nearly two years, with a continued emphasis on quality over timelines. HartsfieldâJackson Atlanta International Airport is the worldâs busiest by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, serving as Delta Air Linesâ primary hub. We'll keep you updated on its release. For all the latest news in flight simulation, be sure to stay tuned on Threshold!

    <summary>Sim: FS24. Miltech and Blackbird Simulations have recently released version 1.0.2 of their MH-60 Multi-Mission Helicopter add-on for MSFS 2020 and 2024, bringing a series of improvements, optimisations, and fixes. The new version introduces a further reworked flight model, aiming to improve overall manoeuvrability, hover control, and responsiveness across pitch, roll, and yaw inputs. Rotor animations and blade coning have also been refined. Optimised textures and further compression have improved VRAM usage by about 1 gigabyte, and mipmapping has been added for further scalability across different hardware. Autopilot and hover mode control logic have been revised for improved stability, alongside more accurate vertical speed control. Version 1.0.2 also includes new keybinds for hover adjustments, as well as clickable rotor brake and search light controls. Visual enhancements such as dynamic dirt, mud, and insect accumulation were also added. According to the changelog, the release resolves more than 40 issues, ranging from livery errors and animation bugs to lighting, radio, and crew call. Specific fixes include adjustments to the APU, tail fold, and pitot cover textures. Several regressions in textures were also addressed. Miltech noted that users who previously installed the low-VRAM patch of the MH-60 should first test the new version 1.0.2 without it, as memory optimisation has been significantly improved in this update. A patch will still be available for those requiring additional performance adjustments. The developers also confirmed ongoing work on Mission Hub, with further improvements, bug fixes, and new features expected soon. Testing is also underway for an Xbox release of both the MH-60 and Mission Hub, with version 1.0.2 set as the release build. The full changelog follows below: â¢ FIXED: Various issues with APU Start (sound looping, fuel starvation, switching on/off)â¢ FIXED: When starting "Ready to Fly", PCLs are now on DIR, and UTIL PUMP is Off.â¢ FIXED: Prime Fuel Pump starving the APU from fuel fixed.â¢ FIXED: Incorrect "Rotor Brake" indication on MD removed.â¢ FIXED: Tail Fold not working correctly on FS24 fixed.â¢ FIXED: Weapon Release cover not hiding with cyclic fixed.â¢ FIXED: AO Shadow on the front panel, Romeo and Tango, fixed.â¢ FIXED: Regression on the Pitot Cover texture fixed.â¢ FIXED: Various regressions on textures fixed.â¢ IMPROVED: Increased Compression Quality on selected external texture COMP Maps [FS20]â¢ IMPROVED: Adjusted Compression Quality on selected textures to lower VRAM consumption. Added mipmapping and removed conditions that made textures not scalable with MSFS Sliders [FS24]â¢ IMPROVED: Various improvements and adjustments to the HOVER Mode PID controller.â¢ IMPROVED: Blade rigidity and coning readjusted. You can read the full update post on Miltech Simulations' Facebook page.  The MH-60 is available for $37.99, via the Miltech Simulations, Blackbird Simulations and iniBuilds stores.

    <summary>Sim: FS24. AG Sim has just released its version of El Hierro Airport (GCHI) for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and 2024. Located on the island of El Hierro, part of the Canary Islands, the airport welcomes nearly 270,000 passengers annually. The airport first opened its doors in 1972 with the goal of serving national air traffic for both passengers and cargo. Between 1989 and 1990, the old control tower was demolished, and a new one was constructed alongside a new passenger terminal. A few years later, the runway was extended, allowing the airport to accommodate larger aircraft. Today, the airport is served by two airlines: Binter Canarias and CanaryFly, which operate flights to Gran Canaria and Tenerife-North. The newly released scenery features detailed 3D buildings, terminal interiors, 8K PBR textures, a 2025 layout, precise terraforming and slopes, and much more. The newly released El Hierro Airport by AG Sim is now available on SimMarket for approximately $16.31. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold! â If you enjoy our content and want to support Threshold, consider joining us on Patreon!</summary>
