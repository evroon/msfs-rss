    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MFSG has recently released their rendition of Yamagata Airport (RJSC) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Yamagata in Japan and has a yearly average of 223,000 passengers. â It was opened by the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War 2 and briefly used by the United States military after the war. Later, it was utilized by the Japanese Self-Defense Force as a training facility.Â  It was turned to civilian control in mid-1964 as a third-class regional airport. Eight years later, the runway was extended to 1,500 meters, leading to a reclassification to Class II in 1979. A new - and final - extension happened in 1981, followed by the construction of a new terminal building in 1984. International charter services started in 1981, taking full advantage of the newly expanded runway. Destinations included Finland, Hungary, New Zealand, and even Mexico. The airport's traffic peak was in 1991, followed by a rapid decline in 1992 due to the inauguration of the Yamagata Shinkansen. While the airport saw almost 500,000 passengers in 1991, the figures were down to 50,000 in 2002.Â  Fuji Dream Airlines (Nagoya, Sapporo), J-Air (Osaka), and Japan Airlines (Tokyo) currently serve it.Â  â The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with an up-to-date ground layout, custom jetways, custom ground-poly, performance-friendly optimization, and more. â It's available onÂ SimMarketÂ for roughly $11.86, requiring at least 29.20 MB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. X-Trident recently released its rendition of the AgustaWestland AW109 for X-Plane 11 and 12. This multi-purpose helicopter is used in a variety of roles, both military and civil. Its development began in the late 1960s, with the first prototype making its maiden flight in 1971. The official FAA certification in 1975 followed, and it was officially introduced in 1976.Â  Originally designed and manufactured by Agusta as A109, it was the first all-Italian helicopter to be mass-produced. An eventual merger of Agusta and Westland Helicopters from Britain led to a rebranding as AW109. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206C engines, the AW109 can cruise at 285 km/h and has a maximum range of 932 km.Â  The add-on features an accurate rendition of the popular helicopter, with a high-quality 3D model, fully animated cockpit elements, a fully digital instrument panel, a functional circuit breaker panel, a custom FADEC with fully automated engine start sequence, realistic performance across all envelopes (tested by real-life pilots), and more.

    <title>XWind Studios Releases Kristiansund Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/xwikri"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6643bc3d01bd7a8f67a8b6a0_kri1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. XWind Studios recently released their rendition of Kristiansund Airport (ENKB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Kristiansund in Norway and has a yearly average of 314,000 passengers. The airport was inaugurated in mid-1970 after almost two years of construction, costing the government 31 million NOK. There was a competition to serve the new airport from the start: Both Braathens SAFE and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) wanted the lucrative route to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Both were granted the route on a temporary basis.Â  The construction and eventual inauguration of Molde airport in 1972âwhich kicked in right after Kristiansund Kvernberget's inaugurationâled to a massive drop in traffic figures, given that it single-handedly cut half the region's catchment area. For comparison, Kristiansund averaged 88,246 passengers a year during its second year of operation, and it took another fourteen years to match that figure again after Molde Airport's inauguration. It underwent a massive overhaul in 2010, funded by Avinor, including a runway expansion, a larger car parking lot, and the construction of a larger terminal.Â  It's currently served by Braathens Regional Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines, and WiderÃ¸e.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, detailed landside recreation, custom elevation for the entire island, custom night lighting, an up-to-date airport layout, a custom GSX profile, and more. â It's available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $13.74, requiring at least 1.90 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <title>Laminar Research Releases X-Plane 12.1.0âs First Public Beta </title>
    <updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/lrx121"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6643d498922cd349104b90c0_xpl1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. Laminar Research recently released the first public beta of X-Plane 12's long-awaited 12.1.0 update. This update introduces improved anti-aliasing, new particle effects, lighting improvements, and more. With a strong focus on visual quality improvements, X-Plane 12.1.0's first public beta brings a glimpse into the heavy strides made into improving the anti-aliasing system, depth of field, shadows, lighting, particle effects, water, and autogen. Below is a list of the key takeaways from the visual improvements at hand:Â  Anti-aliasing (AA):Â Improved quality with better scene handling and coverage for alpha-tested surfaces (those with transparency). Depth of Field:Â More control with a setting for Real Camera Shake (RCAS) and a notification when textures are reduced due to memory limitations. Shadows:Â Smoother shadows overall, cloud shadows on water, and faster rendering times. Lightning:Â This version features more realistic visuals with subtle color adjustments, distance variations, and bolt thickness changes. Sound effects have also been improved for a more immersive experience. Particle Effects:Â The new system allows for particles on ground contact, easier editing with copy/paste, and datarefs for better control. Pre-built effects include jet engine afterburners (JATO), water bombing, ground scrapes, and rotor wash from helicopters. Aircraft configuration files (ACFs) let you disable these effects if desired. Water:Â Fixed water clarity issues, with color and transparency depending on location. Cloud shadows are now visible on water surfaces. Compatibility note: existing X-Plane 11 water scenery packs may not work perfectly due to differences in water rendering and might require updates from the creators. Autogen:Â Enhanced visuals for high-rise buildings in European cities and improved parking aircraft placement at airports, prioritizing larger planes for bigger spots. The update also enhances the G1000 navigation system, including an accurate startup splash screen, a NAV page, a stormscope, datalink weather support, Terrain, aÂ WPT page, anÂ AUX page, and new datarefs.Â  It also includes two additions to the supported flap systems, allowing the accurate simulation of manual flap controls such as the one in the Piper PA-28, with precise and gradual adjustments, and the dial-a-flap system, which is present in some McDonnell-Douglas aircraft. The complete feature list and changelog can be foundÂ here, along with further information. Â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A member of the PMDG forum has discovered an internal link on PMDG's website leading to a user manual for their upcoming Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This manual reveals many features that had not been previously mentioned and provides answers to questions from the community that were left unanswered or only vaguely addressed by the company's CEO, Robert Randazzo. The new website not only includes the manual but also showcases a variety of liveries available for the plane. Furthermore, it unveils several previously undisclosed features, providing users with a comprehensive look at what the plane has to offer. Furthermore, the manual also provides insight into some of the included features. Here is a list of some of the most interesting features: After a user shared the new website, most of the responses and the original message were deleted from the forum. Following this, Mathijs at PMDG published the following: "Kudos to the person who used a domain scanner to find the manual, but this is indeed unplanned, so let's not make it a topic here." In the end, it looks like the manual was not supposed to be released, but when it was, we did get quite a good look at the new plane. If you want to check out the manual, it was available while we were writing this article, but is no longer there and rather humorously they redirected the URL to a Rick Roll. We will keep you informed as more information becomes available about the upcoming PMDG 777. Make sure to stay tuned to Threshold for the most recent flight simulation news!</summary>

In the following years, a cargo terminal was added, along with a warehouse, taxiways and the airport apron reconstruction. The latest expansion was finished in 2007, when a new terminal, consisting of three buildings, and a new control tower were built. Today, Sfax-Thyna Airport serves 6 airlines to 7 destinations, and many charter flights from Germany and UK during the summer season. CAT3DUALâs rendition of DTTX features custom buildings on the airfield, main apron including an eastern expansion, accurate airfield way finders: taxiway signs and markings, airfield lighting placement and colours per Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), custom perimeter wall and more. This scenery can be purchased on SimMarket for approximately 8.68$ and requires at least 135MB of free disk space. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news!</summary>

    <title>FlyTampa Releases Humberside Airport for MSFS</title>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FlyTampa has released their rendition of Humberside Airport (EGNJ) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving Lincolnshire, Kingston upon Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire, this airport welcomes around 90.000 passengers per year. Opened in 1941 as an RAF air base, RAF Kirmington housed the 166th RAF Squadron that operated Avro Lancasters. After 1945, the airport was abandoned for 30 years, until the local council decided to activate the airfield again. After the local area was renamed, the airport was renamed to Humberside Airport. Due to the proximity of other airports, Humberside faces competition from East Midlands and Leeds Bradford Airport. This is because competitive airports have a wider range of passenger flights. The airport serves only two airlines with scheduled passenger flights, KLM to Amsterdam and Eastern Airways to Aberdeen, while during the summer season, TUI has charter flights to Palma de Mallorca, and BH Air to Burgas. FlyTampaâs version of Humberside Airport features Hi-res modelling and PBR textures, a modelled terminal interior with animated passengers, a GSX profile, and LOD performance modelling. This scenery can be purchased on FlyTampaâs website for 12.99$. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

    <title>Jetstream Designs Announces Geneva Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-05-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/664ce3761ae36b5b1651cb09_lsgg1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Jetstream Designs has recently announced the development of Geneva Airport (LSGG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This international Airport serves Grand GenÃ¨ve (Genevaâs metropolitan area) and has a yearly average of 14 million passengers. â It was first established as an airfield in Cointrin, near Geneva (which explains the airport still being informally known as Cointrin Airport), in October 1919. It wasnât until the late 1920s that the airport would get appropriately structured, with concrete hangars instead of makeshift wooden sheds.Â  â The first concrete runway was built in 1937, with a total length of 405 meters.Â  â The airport was heavily expanded during World War 2, as the Swiss authorities banned any departures for safety reasons. The runway was extended to 1200 meters near the end of the war, and provisions were made to ensure further expansion capabilities in the future. The first passenger terminal was built in 1946, costing 2.3 Swiss Francs to the authorities, along with a runway expansion to 2000 meters.Â  The runway was expanded for the last time in 1960, with jet traffic in mind, taking it from 2000 meters to 3900 meters. This is an unusually long runway for an airport of that size, and a territorial exchange had to be made between Switzerland and France to ensure that there would be enough room for it.Â  â In the late 1980s, a new passenger terminal was built, with 12 jet bridges and two ground-floor gates. It ultimately replaced the old one from 1946, which now only opens during winter charter season.Â  â Itâs a hub for Swiss International Air Lines and an operating base for EasyJet Switzerland. Aegean Airlines, Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, easyJet, Emirates, Eurowings, Finnair, ITA, Jet2.com, KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Transavia, TUI Airways, United Airlines, Vueling, and Wizz Air also serve it. While a feature list has not been provided, the many screenshots shared on their social media platforms reveal some of it: custom ground textures, custom jetways, terminal interiors, and custom runway textures. Jetstream also proudly announces that Marcus Nyberg, a scenery developer from Orbx, has joined them to help with Geneva and future projects. Thereâs no pricing or release date information yet, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>
