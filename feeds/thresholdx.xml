    <title>A2A Simulations Announces Aerostar 600 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/a2aa60"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/666df4c4c46e8cd22c52d76e_aerostar.jpg"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. A2A Simulations has recently announced the development of a new Accu-Sim airplane for Microsoft Flight Simulator: the Piper Aerostar 600, a twin-engined propeller aircraft designed and built by Ted Smith Aircraft Company in the late 1960s.Â  Ted Smith, then an already experienced aircraft designer, envisioned a fast twin-engined airplane with no compromises, sleek lines, powerful engines, and speed as the main priority. By the late 1960s, the first prototype was already breaking records, making it the fastest twin-piston general aviation aircraft at the time, thanks to its light construction, low drag, and sheer power.Â  â The Aerostar 600 had two Lycoming IO-540-K engines, producing 290 horsepower each. These allowed it to cruise at 408 km/h, with a service ceiling of 25,000ft and 1,500 miles of total range on a single tank of fuel.Â  â Like their Comanche 250 (released mid-2023), the upcoming airplane will be built on Accu-Sim 2.0 technology. This technology features an advanced aerodynamics system that tries to accurately represent how an aircraft flies through the air, realistic wear and tear on the airframe and engine, in-depth electrical simulation, and much more.Â  â They have owned and operated a real Aerostar 600 for several years, and it was assumed for the longest time that it would be their first product for Microsoft Flight Simulator.Â  Not much has been revealed yet, but they mention itâs an entirely different experience from flying the Comanche, with their Accu-Sim 2.0 technology accurately recreating the feel of flying a piston twin. Itâs expected to be released âlater in 2024.â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Flightbeam Studios has recently released their rendition of San Francisco International Airport (KSFO) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the San Francisco Bay Area with a yearly average of 50.1 million passengers. Initially meant to be a temporary and experimental airport project when the city of San Francisco leased 61 hectares of land in 1927 from the Mills Estate (owned by Ogden L. Mills), it quickly became a permanent commitment with the purchase of the land and its surroundings, totaling up to 450 hectares of area.Â  It was briefly used as a Coast Guard base and an Army Air Corps training and staging base during World War 2. Following the war, international air travel boomed, prompting the airport's final name change to San Francisco International Airport in 1945. The jet age ushered in a new chapter for SFO. In the 1950s, longer runways were constructed to accommodate larger jetliners, and new terminals were built to handle the increased passenger volume and the demands of international travel. SFO's commitment to innovation continued throughout the latter half of the 20th century. The airport embraced new technologies, such as jet bridges and baggage carousel systems, to improve passenger experience. In 1971, SFO became the first airport in the United States to have an automated people mover system, the AirTrain. It's a hub for United Airlines (44% of the market share) and Alaska Airlines (10.66% of the market share) and is visited by multiple international carriers such as Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates, KLM, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, and WestJet. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-detail 4K textures, custom jetways, detailed interior modeling, custom ground clutter, performance-friendly optimization, and much more. It's available on their shop for $19.99, requiring at least 2.54 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>Classic Aircraft Simulations Releases Piper J-3 Cub for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/casj3c"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/667276ca8cc8fdcd74fee341_cub1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Classic Aircraft Simulations has recently released its rendition of the Piper J-3 Cub for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This popular high-wing monoplane, built by Piper Aircraft between 1938 and 1947, had nearly 20,000 manufactured units. The Cub's story begins in the late 1920s with C.G. Taylor, an aeronautical engineer with a vision for a simple, affordable airplane. His initial design, the Taylor Cub, laid the groundwork for the J-3. In 1937, the Piper Aircraft Company acquired the rights to the Taylor Cub and introduced the J-3, boasting a more powerful engine and several improvements. The J-3's key strength was its simplicity: its lightweight fabric-and-steel construction, paired with a low-horsepower engine, made it easy to fly and maintain. Its ease of use and affordable price tag opened the skies to a new generation of pilots. The J-3's impact indeed soared during World War II. The U.S. Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) adopted the J-3 as its primary trainer, churning out thousands of qualified pilots for the war effort. Nicknamed the "Grasshopper" for its ability to take off and land in short fields, the J-3 played a crucial role in training pilots for combat aircraft. Even after the war, surplus J-3s flooded the civilian market, further democratizing aviation and fueling a surge in recreational flying. Thanks to its ability to land in remote locations, J-3's influence extends far beyond pilot training. It is invaluable for tasks like crop dusting, aerial photography, and banner towing. It even played a part in search-and-rescue missions and disaster relief efforts. J-3's versatility and reliability cemented its reputation as a workhorse of the skies. While production of the J-3 ended in 1947, its legacy lives on. Over 20,000 J-3s were built, making it the most-produced airplane in Piper's history. Many remain operational today, cherished by private owners and flown in airshows and recreational outings. Several companies continue producing certified replicas, ensuring the J-3's design inspires new aviators. The add-on features an accurate rendition of the aircraft, with a computational fluid dynamics flight model, hand-prop start procedure simulation, physics-based animations, aircraft state and condition persistence, landing gear failure simulation, interactive refueling, custom visual effects, compact and hideable custom avionics, and much more. The complete feature list follows below: It's available on Contrail for roughly $16.11, requiring at least 2.1 GB of free hard disk space to install. Shout out to DragonRuins for the news scoop!

    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6672a6708727c06797f5804f_Banner_Image.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Black Square has recently released a development update where they previewed their newest project for Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Beechcraft Starship. This futuristic-looking aircraft was one of the most technologically advanced aircraft in the 80s and was designed by Burt Rutan Scaled Composites, a well-known aircraft designer. The Starship was also the first all-composite business aircraft with a pressurized cabin.Â  Unfortunately, despite its design, the Beechcraft Starship was a commercial failure, as during 7 years of production, only 53 were made. Many of the aircraft never found a buyer and were later leased to Raytheon. Today, only 5 Starships are airworthy.Â The Beechcraft Starship was also the first certified aircraft with a canard wing, the first business aircraft with an all-composite structure, the first certified twin-pusher turboprop, the first general aviation aircraft with a glass cockpit, and one of three civilian turboprops that are certified with a service ceiling up to 41.000 feet.Â  According to the last development update, the cabin is finished, and the developers are focusing on the Starshipâs unique systems and avionic suites such as the AMS-850. The AMS-850 is an avionic suite that was used only in the Starship. It was one of the most advanced avionic suites in the 80s, and many of the feature used in todayâs suites were pioneered by the AMS-850. As GPS wasnât publicly available when the prototype made its first flight, the avionics would automatically tune to the nearest navigational aid and would generate an estimate of the current position. The positional estimation could be enhanced by manual pilot input. Along with other navigational receivers, the Beechcraft Starship had receivers for VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio stations, such as Omega. Omega consisted of 9 transmitters located in various locations around the globe.Â  Black Squareâs rendition of the Starship will feature all technology developed for Dukes, which will also be added to the TBM850 in a free update this summer. This update will include a tablet with options to manage payload, control failures, change options, monitor engines, as well as a live schematic of the electrical and environmental control system. The Starship will feature CRT displays that take time to warm up, and navigational databases that can be updated with floppy disks. Over 230 failures and 172 circuit breakers will be present. The Black Square developer will be attending the FSExpo 2024, where you will be able to learn more about this amazing aircraft and its progress. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

Serving the Greater Richmond Region, it is situated approximately 7 miles from downtown Richmond and accommodates over 4.75 million passengers annually. The airport underwent several name changes before becoming Richmond International Airport. In 1927, it was dedicated as Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field and then renamed Richard E. Byrd Airport in 1950. It wasn't until 1984 that it became known as Richmond International Airport. Over the years, the airport has undergone various upgrades and expansions and has seen an increase in passenger traffic and aircraft movements. Today, airlines such as Breeze Airways, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines offer flights to destinations all over the United States. The newly released Richmond International Airport add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with numerous features, including highly detailed buildings, PBR texturing, a partially modeled internal terminal, custom animated jetways, improved lighting, and more. The add-on requires 693.80 MB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $16.09. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: OTHER. After many months of uncertainty, and with questions still swirling about the status of the company as a whole, Honeycomb Aeronauticalâs highly anticipated Charlie Rudder Pedals have gone into production today and will finally ship to customers starting in August, according to a statement from Aerosoft. Early this year, Honeycomb fell into hot water as many months of radio silence led to a statement by the companyâs CEO, Nicki Repenning, admitting that they were struggling financially, and that his former business partner and CEO of Snakebyte-group, Mike Steup, hid this information from him and stole pre-order money set aside for the Charlie Rudder Pedal production had âgone elsewhere.â Snakebyte and Mr. Steup denies these allegations. Threshold interviewed Mr. Repenning as a culmination of a weeks-long initial investigation, which you can read here.  According to Aerosoft, production of the pedals has started today and they have been able to âtest the pre-production models extensively,â and they are âimpressed by the quality of the materials and the realistic feel of the pedals.â Aerosoft plans to start deliveries on August 29th. As a compensation for the long waiting time, all customers who have pre-ordered the Charlie Pedals via the Aerosoft Shop or have already pre-ordered them will receive an Aerosoft Shop voucher worth 30â¬ ($32.17USD). Aerosoft also says that those who are attending this weekendâs FlightSimExpo in Las Vegas can try out the Charlie Pedals at their booth. As a special promotion for the UEFA European Championship, New customers can get a Honeycomb Alpha Yoke at a discounted price of 199.99â¬ ($214.43USD), for as long as the German national team is in the tournament. The Charlie Pedals can now be pre-ordered on the Aerosoft Shop for 369.99â¬ ($396.70USD).  â Stay tuned to Threshold for more high-quality flight simulation news!</summary>
