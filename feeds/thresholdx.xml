    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SPINOZA has recently released their version of Albert Whitted Airport (KSPG) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport is located in and serves the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, which is renowned as the birthplace of the first scheduled commercial airline flight. Situated in the Tampa Bay area, the airport features a total of two runways. Construction of Albert Whitted Airport began in 1928, and the airport officially opened in 1929. In 1934, National Airline initiated service to the airport, but this ceased after World War II when the airline shifted operations to St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport. Upon its opening in 1929, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company stationed one of its airships at Albert Whitted Airport, marking it as one of the first airports to serve as a base for their blimps. Over the years, a Coast Guard Air Station was also established at the airport. Today, the airport remains a popular choice for general aviation in the area. The recently released scenery package provides Microsoft Flight Simulator users with a variety of features for the Florida-located airport. The newly released Albert Whitted Airport is now available on SimMarket for approximately $18.34 and requires 487.25 MB of storage space.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Propair Flight recently released its version of Kaunas Airport (EYKA) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Located in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, it is the second busiest civilian airport in the country after Vilnius Airport, catering to approximately 1.3 million passengers annually. Kaunas Airport opened for flights in 1988. Flights were transferred from the former S. Darius and S. GirÄnas Airport to the new Kaunas Airport. It wasn't until 1991 that the airport became an international airport. This happened after Lithuania acquired its independence. Throughout the years, the airport has seen a variety of airlines flying to different destinations, along with improvements to the airport and its infrastructure. Today, the airport is a hub for Ryanair, but also serves airlines such as Wizz Air, Corendon Europe, Freebird Airlines, and SkyUp. These airlines offer flights to destinations such as London, Madrid, and Milan, and the airport handles around 1.3 million passengers yearly. The newly released Kaunas Airport add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with numerous features, providing users with plenty of content to explore. The add-on requires 1.88 GB of storage space and is available on SimMarket for approximately $14.76. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <title>iBlueYonder Previews Portland International Airport v2 for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-06-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iBlueYonder has just announced a new update for their KPDX scenery for MSFS. Serving the metropolitan area of Portland, Portland Intl Airport has over 16,000,000 passenger operations and 190,000 aircraft movements per year. â Opened in 1936 as a âsuper airportâ, it was a part of the New Deal, and was described as "Portland's most significant public works improvement during the New Deal era". It had five runways, and the terminal was on the northern side of the airfield. In 1952, a new longer runway was built, along with the new terminal. â The first international non-stop flight from Portland was operated by Western, on Boeing 720B to Vancouver. By 1974, the airport was served by all major US domestic carriers: Braniff, Cascade, Continental, Eastern, Hughes Airwest, Northwest Orient, Pan Am, United and Western. The most popular route was to Seattle, with seven airlines flying with planes as big as Boeing 747-200. During the same year, the south runway was extended to 11,000ft and the terminal building was renovated and expanded a few years later. During the 80s, it was Deltaâs hub for flights to Asia, as it lacked aircraft that could fly non-stop from Atlanta. In 1995, the carrier offered flights to Tokyo, Seoul, Nagoya, Taipei, and Bangkok. Unfortunately, due to other airlines introducing flights to Asia, Delta closed the hub in PDX in 2001. A couple of years later though, Northwest Airlines introduced nonstop flights from Portland to their hub - Tokyo Narita. Instead of opening more domestic flights like Delta did, NWA used code-share agreements with other airlines to funnel passengers to Portland. In March 2020, the main terminal began the 5-year long expansion process. The construction of the main terminal was estimated to be finished by May 2024, but due to construction incidents, it was delayed to August 2024. Today, PDX is served by 22 airlines to more than 80 destinations in North America and Europe and is a hub for Alaska Airlines. It is also a big cargo hub, as it receives flights from 13 cargo airlines, mostly in the USA. iBlueYonderâs rendition of KPDX will feature the new main terminal with a modelled interior, Concourses B, C and D with interior, and the new Concourse E, new toll plaza, FAA Administration building, custom animated jetways, new ground support equipment, and new animated objects and people.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 has just released its latest airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This time, it's Truckee Tahoe Airport (KTRK) that has been created. Located in and serving the town of Truckee, California, this American airport averages 32.000 aircraft operations per year. Truckee Tahoe Airport opened in 1958 and is situated within the Sierra Nevada mountain range at an altitude of 5.900 feet. Over the years, various changes and upgrades have been made to the airport and its facilities. Currently, the airport features two asphalt runways and serves as a general aviation airport without commercial service. However, commercial flights are available at the nearby Reno-Tahoe International Airport. The airport accommodates a range of general aviation aircraft, and the presence of private jets is quite common. The scenery features Full Detail Buildings, Realistic Ground Markings, Hi-Res Ground Images, Stunning Night Effects, High Detail Airport Vehicles, Fencing, Vegetation, Static Aircraft, PBR Materials, and more. The newly released Truckee Tahoe Airport is now available on SimMarket for $12.86. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG recently published a statement regarding checkout issues with their newly released Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator, blaming it on a much higher demand than initially expected. Their Triple Seven, one of the most anticipated add-ons of 2024, allegedly exceeded 20 sales per second for more than four minutes after release. This significantly exceeded the figures from their previous major releaseâthe 737-700 in 2022âand went well above their expected threshold, leading to orders being batched into holding. According to Robert Randazzo, the first-day unit sales of their 737 were surpassed within minutes, a demand much higher than they had initially planned with their eCommerce provider.Â  They have been actively working through the batches and providing everyone with a download link and license key. Customers are instructed to contact their support if the email is not sent within the expected time frame (60-120 minutes from their publication, with 60 minutes to go when our article is published). The brand-new airplane is available at PMDG.com for $77.73. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. The developers of SharedFlight, a plugin for the shared cockpit for X-Plane 11 and 12, have just announced the release date of the highly-anticipated addon. After 4 years of development, SharedFlight will be released on June 28th.Â  It is supported for Windows, Linux and Mac, as well as X-Plane 11 and X-Plane 12. Unfortunately, cross-compatibility between XP11 and XP12 is impossible due to differences between the two simulators. Unlike other addons for sharing your cockpit for X-Plane, SharedFlight has built-in aircraft configurations, making it easier to use. In order for two (or more) users to connect and fly together, both of them will need to have the same aircraft version and AIRAC in sim.Â  The pricing will be tier-based. There are three tiers: Free, Basic and Premium. On release, 13 aircrafts will be supported: the Laminar C172 and C172 with G1000, Rotate MD-11, inBuilds A300/A310, ToLiss A319/A320neo/A321/A340-600, Zibo 737-800, Felis B747-200 and FlightFactor 757/767. More aircraft will be supported after release. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight sim news and reviews!</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. In partnership with Thranda Design, Just Flight has developed a rendition of the Piper PA-28R for X-Plane 12, featuring a highly detailed simulation of the popular four-seater first introduced in 1976. As the name suggests, the PA-28R Arrow III is the third iteration of the Piper Arrow lineup. It was launched in 1967 with the PA-28R-180, followed by the Arrow II. Five years later, it was majorly upgraded with a semi-tapered wing, larger fuel tanks (meaning increased range), and several other improvements and commercialized under the Arrow III moniker.  The add-on features high-quality 8K texturing throughout, reworked PBR materials, a brand new EFB tablet with aircraft configuration states, checklists, and customization options, a dynamic livery feature with color, design, and dirt level change on the fly, a high-quality FMOD sound set, and much more.Â  Itâs available on Just Flightâs website for roughly $42.99, requiring at least 2.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. PMDG has recently issued an update to their newly released Boeing 777-300ER for Microsoft Flight Simulator, addressing some WASM crashes, FMC bugs, and geometry fixes.Â  They also anticipate a series of updates in the next 14 days, aiming to mitigate user experience-disrupting issues (primarily), and the other teams (model, art, and sound) will also push their fixes. What hasnât been fixed yet is an SU15-induced issue plaguing their 737 and 777, causing both to freeze entirely and stop responding. They have been working with Asobo to find out the root cause, and âvictimsâ are encouraged to file a support ticket with PMDG so they can be surveyed.Â  Update 2.00.0034, issued via Operations Center, addresses the CLR bug that plagued many day one 777 pilots; hitting cancel on the EICAS no longer freezes the aircraft, and many model adjustments were made. The changelog follows below: â The next update is already being tested and will fix long directory names preventing the installation process from working altogether.Â  The Triple Seven is available on PMDG.com for $77.73.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. iFly has recently published a new development update for their upcoming Boeing 737 Max 8 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, featuring a gallery with over 30 preview images. Other than the images (which say more than a thousand words, one could argue), iFly claims the development is moving along nicely. They have been considering creating a Discord channel to keep everyone updated on the project as it progresses. The 737Max is Boeingâs response to the A320Neo. It has bigger, high-tech, and very efficient engines, a different wing, and a completely new glass cockpit while operating in a similar fashion to its previous iteration, the 737NG. With that, airlines save money in training costs as the commonality is retained.Â  Thereâs no pricing or release date information, but Threshold will keep you informed! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TFDi, a development group well-known for their products such as B717 and PACX, have just released the trailer for the long-awaited MD-11. Unveiled yesterday on TFDiâs YouTube channel, it showcased the progress through years of development, with an interesting song choice in the background.Â  The trailer previewed mostly internal and external visuals, unfortunately, we couldnât hear any sounds. We could see that significant effort has been made by the developer team in modelling and texturing. At the very end of the video, we could see the release date - 2nd July! TFDiâs MD-11 Base Pack will cost $69.99 (cargo or passenger), while the Expansion pack (conveniently named The One You Did Not Purchase Already), is priced at $9.99. Later in 2024, the Extended Simulation Package will also be available for purchase. The package will include operational failures, an advanced custom failures menu, and circuit breaker functionality. The MD-11 will be compatible with MSFS, P3Dv4/v5/v6, although support for MSFS2024 still hasnât been officially confirmed until the developers receive more information about the upcoming simulator. â Stay tuned to Threshold for more flightsim news and high-quality reviews! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. TFDi has recently released their rendition of the passenger and cargo variants of the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 for Microsoft Flight Simulator (and Prepar3d), an ETOPS-capable trijet introduced in 1990 and still in use by many cargo airlines around the World.Â  The original idea behind the MD-11 development was to take the DC-10 as a baseline and modernize it with the latest and greatest in technology from the early 90s, albeit without going overboard given McDonnellâs financial situation, which led to suboptimal fuel efficiency in comparison with the soon-to-be rivals at the time (Airbus A330/A340, Boeing 777), but with greater maximum range, even if briefly (which made it a relatively short-lived airplane, with only 200 units built).Â  The timing couldnât have been worse for a brand-new trijet, as airlines were already prioritizing fuel-efficient twin-engine airplanes and slowly phasing out their fuel-guzzling three, four-engine jets. Unsurprisingly enough, the MD-11 didnât take off in orders. TFDIâs rendition brings the General Electric engines (Pratt &amp; Whitney option to come later), with custom modeled systems, a custom-built flight management computer, high-resolution texturing, high-detail cabins (pax and cargo), and an onboard EFB allowing you to control payload and change specific settings.Â  Their âa la carteâ pricing model allows you to pick only the variant(s) you want: both cost $69.99 (cargo or passenger), and the other variant can be obtained for an extra $9.99, making it $80 for both. An â extended simulation packageâ is set to be released in late 2024, adding failures and circuit breakers. The base packages can be found on TFDiâs website.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. MXI Design recently released its version of Karpathos Airport (LGKP) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Located on the Greek island of Karpathos, the airport serves approximately 270.000 passengers annually, who are seeking sun and fun in the Greek islands. Karpathos Airport opened in 1970 as a small airport with limited facilities. Initially, it had only a 500 square meter building. Construction for new airport facilities began in 2005, and the new airport terminal was completed in 2009. The new airport buildings covers a total of 12.500 square meters, a significant increase from the original 500. Today, the airport is a crucial hub for the island, connecting it with destinations both within the country and around the world. The airport serves a variety of seasonal and year-round destinations, including Athens, Amsterdam, Rome, and more, welcoming around 270.000 passengers annually. The scenery package includes accurately modeled terminal and airport buildings, up-to-date ground layouts, PBR implementation, custom CGL aerial imagery, a detailed handmade terrain model, and more. The newly released Karpathos Airport requires 1.81 GB of storage space, and it is available on both SimMarket and Orbx for approximately $10.76. â For the latest flight simulation news, remember to stay tuned on Threshold!</summary>
