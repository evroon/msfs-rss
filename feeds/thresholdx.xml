    <title>Just Flight Publishes New A300B4 Development Update for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/a300ov"/>
    <link href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/66d25607a14a1366c7bad0d6_airbus1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Just Flight has recently published a new development update concerning their progress on the upcoming Airbus A300B4 for Microsoft Flight Simulator, showcasing their work on the overhead panel. Like most modern airliners, the overhead panel houses the controls for some of the most complex systems, albeit not in the same way: the A300B4 still had a flight engineer panel. Still, it paved the way for the two-pilot cockpit philosophy, which was present in every other Airbus from there on. That transitional period becomes quite evident when thereâs a mixture of awfully familiar switches and a plethora of annunciator lights, switches, and knobs that are no longer commonly seen in modern airplanes (replaced by automation or simplified). But even so, there are already glimpses of the contemporary Airbus philosophy that would dictate the future of their planes.Â  Panels are clearly and accurately labeled, annunciator lights are color-coded, and every rotating drum, knob, and switch is 3D modeled rather than a flat bidimensional texture. Every object has been texturized to look as realistically worn out as possible, as you would expect from an old airplane. They will showcase the engineerâs panel next, and there is still no information regarding the release date or pricing.Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <title>SIMMAN Releases Surat Thani International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/surtha"/>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. SIMMAN has recently released their rendition of Surat Thani International Airport (VTSB) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Surat Thani, Thailand, and has a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers. It was initially built as an airfield during World War 2 and left aside for many years after due to the existence of Donnok Airport, Surat Thaniâs former main airport. Although a development plan for the decrepit airfield was proposed in the early 1970s, the government decided to drop it and focus its financial resources elsewhere (Phuket International Airport). Two years later, the population pushed for a reconsideration, and the Ministry of Defence also embraced it. Development finally started in 1978, and the airport was officially opened in 1981.Â  Plans are underway to expand the airportâs apron and passenger terminal, doubling its passenger handling capabilities. Nok Air, Thai AirAsia, Thai Lion Air, and Thai VietJet Air serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with custom ground textures, custom jetways, custom night lighting, a custom-made terminal interior, and more. Itâs available on SimMarket for roughly $17.29, requiring at least 818.17 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news!Â  â</summary>

    <title>FSFORMOSA Releases Yonaguni Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-08-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FSFORMOSA has recently released their rendition of Yonaguni Airport (ROYN) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves the city of Yonaguni in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, with a yearly average of 100,000 passengers. It was constructed by the Japanese Army in 1943, being a vital airbase for their war strategy due to its location (awfully close to Taiwan). The post-war period led to abandonment, and its transformation into a civilian airport was only to happen over a decade later, in 1957. The airport's initial operations were modest, with small aircraft providing essential transportation links. As time passed, the airport's facilities were gradually upgraded to accommodate larger planes and growing passenger numbers. International service started in 2007, with flights to Taiwan operated by Uni Air. That helped consolidate the airport as a gateway to the island. It's currently served by Ryukyu Air Commuter, with routes to Ishigaki and Naha. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR texturing, custom ground textures, custom POIs, performance-friendly optimization, custom vegetation, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $15.41, requiring at least 1.09 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. UK2000 Scenery has recently released their rendition of Big Bear City Airport (L35) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Big Bear City and San Bernardino, California, and has an average of 30,000 aircraft operations per year. The first airstrip in the area was established in the early 1920s. It was mainly utilized for private pilots and airmail service. The overall structure was precarious for its first two decades, and the runway was not paved.Â  The US Army Corps of Engineers constructed a new runway at the airport in the 1940s, allowing it to be used as a training airfield during World War 2. Following the war, Big Bear City Airport continued to expand. New hangars were built, and the airport's facilities were upgraded to accommodate the growing number of private aircraft and commercial flights. The airport's strategic location in the mountains made it a popular destination for pilots seeking scenic flights and challenging flying conditions. The region's ever-increasing popularity led to increased growth in traffic figures, which forced the administration to implement measures to manage the congestion in a safe - and less disruptive to the residents - manner: specific arrival and departure procedures and noise abatement rules.Â  The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with detailed buildings, custom ground textures, high-resolution ground imagery, custom night lighting, performance-friendly optimization, PBR materials, custom static aircraft, and more. It's available on SimMarket for roughly $13.29, requiring at least 23.45 MB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. WF Scenery Studio recently released their rendition of Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (ZSSS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Shanghai, the largest city in China, with a yearly average of 33.2 million passengers. Construction started more than a century ago, in 1921, and opened for mixed civilian use in 1923.Â  It was occupied by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War and used as an air force base. Even after being handed over to the Chinese government, it remained used for military purposes, only being fully converted into a civilian airport between 1963 and 1964. Two major expansions followed in 1984 and 1988, significantly increasing the airportâs passenger handling capabilities. Since the early 2000s, the airport has mainly operated domestic routes, with most international routes being transferred to Shanghai Pudong. The only exceptions to this rule are a couple of international flights to Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Tokyo.Â  It was expanded in 2010 for the Shanghai Expo, which included a new runway and a new terminal capable of handling up to 40 million passengers a year. Itâs four times the size of Terminal 1, inaugurated in 1964. It houses 80% of the domestic airlines at the airport. Terminal 1 underwent a major renovation at the end of 2014, bringing it up to modern standards. The renovation was done in two phases, with the final phase reaching completion in 2018. Itâs a hub for China Eastern Airlines, Juneyao Air, and Shanghai Airlines. Air China, Air Macau, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, China United Airlines, EVA Air, Hainan Airlines, Hebei Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Lucky Air, OTT Airlines, Shandong Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Spring Airlines, Tianjin Airlines, Tibet Airlines, and XiamenAir also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with PBR textures, realistic ground markings, a detailed terminal interior, custom jetways, animated vehicles, and more. Itâs available in the MSFS Marketplace for $23.99.Â Shout out to aca343 for the news scoop! Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Aerosoft has recently released their rendition of Frankfurt Airport (EDDF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is Germanyâs busiest airport, with a yearly average of 59 million passengers. Inaugurated in mid-1936, Frankfurt quickly became a central distribution point for airmail transport to North America, and its passenger figures were not too shabby: It carried over 58,000 people during its first year of operation!Â  It was transferred to the Luftwaffe during World War 2, which led to the dismantling of the famous airships and their hangars. Then, the runway was fully converted into a military airfield. Four years later, Allied bombings destroyed it. Shortly after the war, the US Army took over the airport and built a new main runway and a base (Rhein-Main base).Â  In the early 1950s, civil air traffic slowly returned to normal: over 400,000 passengers passed through the airport in 1951. It wasnât until 1958 that Frankfurt would emerge as an international airline hub with the opening of East Terminal. Within four years, it was already too small for the figures at hand, with Frankfurt being the second busiest airport in Europe after Heathrow. In 1965, a new terminal was built to handle 30 million passengers per year, followed by a runway extension to accommodate larger aircraft. A new main terminal, known as the âCentral Terminal,â was built in 1972. It is divided into three concourses with 56 gates. At the time, it was assumed that the capacity would be sufficient for the next 30 years! Work on Terminal 2 started sooner than expected (in the early 1990s) because it turned out their Central Terminal was insufficient for the next thirty years. It opened in 1994, bringing the passenger handling capacity to 54 million passengers annually. Developed by Jo Erlend Sund, Lukas Vezyroglou, and their team, Mega Airport Frankfurt promises a highly accurate rendition of Germanyâs busiest airport. It features custom ground textures, custom jetways,Â  custom ground service equipment, terminal interiors, custom terraforming, and much more. Itâs available on the Aerosoft Shop for roughly $22.17 (excluding VAT) and requires at least 4.5 GB of free hard disk space to install.
