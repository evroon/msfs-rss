    <summary>Sim: MSFS. sim-wings recently updated its rendition of Munich International Airport (EDDM) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, addressing a wide list of bugs and making many enhancements, keeping the scenery up to date with its real-world counterpart. It serves Munich and Upper Bavaria with a yearly average of 47.9 million passengers.Â  It opened in 1992, replacing Munich-Riem Airport, which served Munich from 1939 to 1992. It was deemed hard to expand because of the growing number of inhabitants around its proximity, leading to the desire to move the airport to a completely different location. Construction work started in 1980 in the small village of Franzheim, whose 400 inhabitants were moved elsewhere. Operations began on 17 May 1992, with Riem closing the night before. â It's one of Lufthansa's main hubs, with a comprehensive route network. Condor, Eurowings, Eurowings Discover, and TUIfly Deutschland also base themselves at the airport. â Update 2.2.0 includes many corrected taxiway signs, removal of floating objects, Terminal 2 improvements (improved Lufthansa sign, for example), theÂ addition of a meteorology station near RWY 26L, jetway connection tweaks, and much more. The complete changelog follows below: â It's available on theÂ Aerosoft Store for roughly $24.99, requiring at least 4 GB of free hard disk space to install.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. FeelThere has recently released its version of Lisbon Airport (LPPT) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. Serving the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, it is the 12th largest airport in Europe, serving over 33.6 million passengers yearly. Lisbon Airport opened on October 15th, 1942 during World War II, but remained neutral throughout the war. This allowed both German and British operators to fly to the airport. By 1946, major airlines like KLM, Iberia, and Pan Am started using the airport. In 1959, the airport underwent major upgrades to handle airliners like the classic Boeing 707. In 1983, there were more upgrades to buildings and facilities, and in 1991, the first air bridges were installed. Since then, the airport has been growing and attracting tons of airlines to operate there. Today, TAP Air Portugal, Azores Airlines, easyJet, and Ryanair have hubs there, and you can fly all over the world from New York to Dubai or Amsterdam. The newly released Lisbon Airport add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator includes many features, such as highly detailed buildings, PBR texturing, real-world elevation data, runway slope, custom jetways, custom lighting, and more.

    <title>GearDown Simulations &amp; db Scenery Release Guarulhos International Airport for MSFS</title>
    <updated>2024-04-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <link href="/news/dbsgru"/>
    <link href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5b27a494dc3d312fe5c01da8/6618c9dead3989329b5a7ebe_gdru1.webp"/>
    <summary>Sim: MSFS. GearDown Simulations and db Scenery have recently released their rendition of Guarulhos International Airport (SBGR) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and has a yearly average of 41.3 million passengers, making it the busiest airport in the country. The airport's planning started back in 1967, when the government first considered renovating the airport infrastructure in the country and ran some studies to figure out which step to take next, leading to a straightforward conclusion: Congonhas (SÃ£o Paulo's main airport at the time) was not big enough to sustain the ever-growing demand, nor could it be easily expanded, which led to a plan B: transforming a former Air Force Base into a full-fledged international airport. After decades of planning, construction started in 1980, with three runways and four passenger terminals in mind at first, which turned into two runways and two terminals due to time and cost constraints. It was inaugurated five years later and quickly became the city's primary airport.  â Four years after the inauguration, the runways were extended, and the passenger terminals were expanded, bringing the overall capacity from 7.5 million passengers a year to 8.5.  A third terminal, planned for 2001, was built a decade later, along with Terminal 4. The first phase (of Terminal 4's construction) had it holding up to 5.5 million passengers a year, and the second phase brought it to its intended capacity of 8 million passengers, making it so the airport could handle 28.5 million passengers in total. The terminals were renumbered in 2015, with Terminal 4 becoming Terminal 1, Terminals 1 and 2 becoming Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 retaining its numbering. â It's a hub for Gol Transportes AÃ©reos and LATAM Brasil and served by Azul, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, American Airlines, Avianca, British Airways, Copa Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Iberia, ITA Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, TAP Air Portugal, United Airlines, and more. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with 4K PBR textures, an up-to-date taxiway layout, custom landside, custom terrain mesh, custom ambient sounds, dynamic lighting effects, detailed ground markings, and more. It's available in the MSFSÂ Marketplace for $9. Refer to the product page for further information.  Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Imaginesim has recently released the V2 of their Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for Microsoft Flight Simulator. The airport serves Singapore with a yearly average of 58.9 million passengers, making it one of the world's busiest.Â  It was inaugurated 42 years ago when the Singaporean government was forced to build a new airport toÂ cope with the region's ever-growing demand for air travel.Â  At first, their original plan was to expand Paya Lebar, the former main airport in Singapore, but the 1973 Oil crisis changed everything. By 1975, they had already decided to build a brand new airport at the eastern tip of the main island of Changi, at the Changi Air Base. After its first year of operation, the airport had already handled an average of 12.1 million passengers, which led to the construction of a second passenger terminal in the 1990s. Terminal 3 soon followed in 2008, and then Terminal 4 in 2017. Terminal 5, which isÂ planned to be larger than all four combined, is expected to open in 2030. â It's a hub for FedEx Express, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, and Singapore Airlines. AirAsia, Air Canada, Air China, Air France, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EVA Air, Garuda Indonesia, Hainan Airlines, IndiGo, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Swiss, United Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines also serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with high-definition textures, performance optimization, custom VDGS, custom animated jetways, 52 square kilometers of total coverage, Terminal 5's construction area, and more. â It's available on theirÂ websiteÂ for roughly $24.75.

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. RW Profiles has recently released their rendition of Springfield-Branson National Airport (KSGF) for Microsoft Flight Simulator, serving the cities of Springfield and Branson in Missouri with a yearly average of 1.3 million passengers as of 2023. It opened as Springfield-Greene County Airport in July 1945, replacing their former - much smaller - main airport.Â  American Airlines started scheduled service to the newly built airport in that same year, only pulling out in 1963. Chicago and Southern landed in 1948, and Ozark in 1951. Ozark was also responsible for the airportâs first scheduled jet service with their brand-new DC-9s in 1966.Â  The airportâs current name was adopted in 1992 as the administration attempted to capitalize on Bransonâs ever-growing tourist industry (even though itâs around 80 km away).Â  In May 2006, construction work started on a new terminal, inaugurated three years later, designed by Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills.Â  Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta Air Lines, Delta Connection, United Express, DHL, FedEx Express, and UPS Airlines serve it. The scenery features an accurate rendition of the airport, with hand-made ground textures, true-to-life landside recreation, accurate night lighting, aÂ custom runway, highly detailed models, up-to-date airport layout, LOD optimization, and an official GSX profile. Itâs available on theÂ iniBuilds StoreÂ for roughly $16.24, requiring at least 2.35 GB of free hard disk space to install. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â</summary>

    <summary>Sim: X-Plane. FlightFactor has recently published a statement on their social network pages with their final decision on the release policy of their upcoming Boeing 777 v2 for X-Plane, including an exclusive non-public alpha program and a public beta later down the line. A previous statement made by Ramzzess on X-Plane.Org Forums stirred quite a bit of drama from the community as it mentioned their ponderation of a beta release without any vertical guidance at all, which led to a poll and their decision to feature a non-public alpha program first, where a select few would be chosen to purchase and test the product after signing a non-disclosure agreement.Â  Later, a public beta will roll out with all the major features (except CPDLC). Therefore, once that is out, the public beta testers will not have to experience the 777 without a working VNAV. Invitations for the closed alpha have been rolling out since yesterday (23/04).

    <summary>Sim: MSFS. Brazil Land Games has shared more previews of their upcoming BrasÃ­lia - President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport (SBBR), the third busiest airport in Brazil with a yearly average of 13.5 million passengers. â The airport was built in 1956, four years before the city it serves, which was still under construction. With a small wooden terminal and a 324-meter-long runway, it received its first flight and inauguration in 1957. The runway was later extended to its current length of 3,300 meters, which had been part of the original plan all along, but for whatever reason, they made it 90% shorter at first. A proper terminal building was inaugurated in 1971, designed by TÃ©rcio Fontana Pacheco, a Brazilian Air Force architect. The first major renovation happened in 1990, with terminal expansions, the first circular satellite, and more. It was divided into a two-phase project that reached total completion in 2004, followed by the construction of the second runway in 2005. New expansion work was announced in 2009 to prepare the airport for the 2014 World Cup. It consisted of an enlargement of the apron and taxiways, a passenger terminal renovation (and enlargement), and extra parking lots, mitigating an issue with the airport operating at capacity (85%) for many years. Itâs served by AerolÃ­neas Argentinas, Azul Brazilian Airlines, Copa Airlines, Gol Transportes AÃ©reos, LATAM Brasil, LATAM PerÃº, TAP Air Portugal, and Voepass Linhas AÃ©reas. The upcoming scenery is said to feature animated moving walkways, an up-to-date ground layout, terminal interiors, custom jetways with detailed interior, detailed landside, and more. Thereâs no release date yet, but itâs said to be coming soon. Stay tuned to Threshold for more flight simulation news! â â</summary>
